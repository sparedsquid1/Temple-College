Tyrosine [[Kinase Inhibitors]] (TKIs) and [[EGFR Inhibitors]] (EGFR) inhibitors are targeted therapies primarily used in the treatment of various cancers. These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] work by interfering with specific molecular pathways that are essential for cancer cell growth and survival.

### Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs):

**Tyrosine kinases** are enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a specific amino acid in a protein. This phosphorylation is a key step in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell division, growth, and apoptosis (programmed cell death). In many cancers, tyrosine kinases are overactive or mutated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

#### **Interactions:**
- TKIs work by blocking the ATP-binding site of the tyrosine kinase enzyme, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of target proteins. This disruption halts the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth and survival.

#### **Examples of TKIs:**
1. **[[imatinib]] (Gleevec):** Used to treat chronic myeloid [[Leukemia]] ([[chronic myelocytic leukemia]]) by inhibiting the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase.
2. **[[erlotinib]] (Tarceva):** Targets the EGFR tyrosine kinase, used in non-small cell lung cancer ([[non–small-cell lung cancer]]) and pancreatic cancer.
3. **[[sunitinib]] (Sutent):** Targets multiple tyrosine kinases, including those involved in angiogenesis (VEGFR), used in renal cell [[Carcinoma]] and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).

### EGFR Inhibitors:

**[[EGFR Inhibitors]] (EGFR)** is a transmembrane protein that, when activated by binding with its specific ligands, triggers a cascade of downstream signaling pathways promoting cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Overexpression or mutation of EGFR is common in various cancers, such as [[non–small-cell lung cancer]], colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancers.

#### **Interactions:**
- [[EGFR Inhibitors]] block the activity of EGFR, either by preventing the binding of ligands to the receptor or by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. This inhibition disrupts the signaling pathways necessary for cancer cell proliferation and survival.

#### **Types of EGFR Inhibitors:**
1. **[[Monoclonal antibodies]]:**
   - **[[cetuximab]] (Erbitux):** Binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, preventing ligand binding and receptor activation.
   - **[[panitumumab]] (Vectibix):** Similar mechanism to [[cetuximab]], used primarily in colorectal cancer.

2. **Small Molecule Inhibitors (TKIs):**
   - **[[gefitinib]] (Iressa):** Inhibits the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, primarily used in [[non–small-cell lung cancer]] with EGFR mutations.
   - **[[osimertinib]] (Tagrisso):** Targets specific EGFR mutations, including the T790M resistance mutation in [[non–small-cell lung cancer]].

### Clinical Considerations and Side Effects:
- **Resistance:** A significant challenge with TKIs and [[EGFR Inhibitors]] is the development of resistance, either through additional mutations in the target protein or through activation of alternative signaling pathways.
- **Side Effects:**
  - **TKIs:** Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and skin rash. Specific toxicities can depend on the targeted kinase.
  - **[[EGFR Inhibitors]]:** Skin rash, diarrhea, and, in some cases, interstitial lung disease (especially with TKIs targeting EGFR).

### Conclusion:
TKIs and [[EGFR Inhibitors]] have revolutionized cancer treatment by offering more targeted approaches with potentially fewer side effects compared to [[Traditional Chemotherapy]]. However, ongoing research is necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve the efficacy of these therapies in various cancer types.
