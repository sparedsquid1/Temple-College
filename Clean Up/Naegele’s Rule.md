Naegele's Rule is a standard way of estimating a pregnant woman's due date. It is based on the first day of her last menstrual period (LMP). The rule assumes a regular menstrual cycle of 28 days and works as follows:

1. **Start with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP)**.
2. **Add one year**.
3. **Subtract three months**.
4. **Add seven days**.

This gives an approximate due date for delivery. 

For example, if the first day of the LMP is January 1st:
- Add one year → January 1st of the following year.
- Subtract three months → October 1st.
- Add seven days → October 8th.

So, the estimated due date would be October 8th.

Keep in mind that this rule assumes a 28-day cycle and may not be as accurate for women with irregular cycles. [[ultrasound]] measurements can provide more precise dating, especially early in pregnancy.
