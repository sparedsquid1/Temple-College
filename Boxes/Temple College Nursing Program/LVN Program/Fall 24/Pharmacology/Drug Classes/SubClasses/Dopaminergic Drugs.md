### Adverse Reactions 
During early treatment with [[levodopa]]/ [[carbidopa]], adverse reactions are usually not a problem, because of the resolution of Parkinson-like symptoms. As the medication’s effectiveness lessens, generalized adverse reactions include the following: 
- Dry [[Mouth]] and difficulty in swallowing 
- Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting 
- Abdominal pain and constipation Increased hand tremor 
- Headache and dizziness 

The most serious adverse reactions seen with [[levodopa]] include choreiform movements (involuntary muscular twitching of the limbs or facial muscles) and dystonic movements (muscular spasms most often affecting the [[Tongue]], jaw, eyes, and neck). [[amantadine]] can reduce these symptoms when added to [[levodopa]]-based [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]. Less common but still serious reactions include mental changes such as [[Dementia]], [[Depression]], psychotic episodes, paranoia, and suicidal tendencies (covered in Unit 4— [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that Affect the [[CNS]]).

The client should be screened for unusual skin lesions, because [[levodopa]] can activate malignant [[Melanoma]]. [[levodopa]] is used cautiously in clients with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, peptic ulcer disease, renal or hepatic disease, and psychosis. [[levodopa]] and combination [[Antiparkinson]] [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] (e.g., [[carbidopa]]/ [[levodopa]]) are classified in [[Preg Cat C]] and are used with caution during pregnancy and lactation.
