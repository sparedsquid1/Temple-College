Myalgia refers to muscle pain or discomfort that can occur in one or multiple muscles throughout the body. It is a common symptom that can result from a variety of causes, ranging from minor injuries to systemic diseases.

### Symptoms:
- **Pain:** Varies in intensity, from mild to severe.
- **Stiffness:** Muscle stiffness, especially after periods of inactivity.
- **Weakness:** Reduced muscle strength may accompany pain.
- **Tenderness:** Affected muscles may be tender to the touch.
- **Swelling or Inflammation:** In some cases, muscles may appear swollen or feel inflamed.

### Causes:
Myalgia can arise from numerous factors, including:

- **Injury or Strain:** Overexertion, muscle sprains, or tears due to physical activity.
- **Infections:** Viral infections (like the flu), bacterial infections, or other systemic infections can lead to muscle pain.
- **Chronic Conditions:**
  - Fibromyalgia: A chronic condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness.
  - Chronic fatigue syndrome: Often associated with muscle pain, fatigue, and other symptoms.
  - Autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis).
- **Medications:** Some medications, such as statins, can cause muscle pain as a side effect.
- **Metabolic Disorders:** Conditions affecting metabolism can lead to muscle discomfort.
- **Dehydration:** Lack of fluids can cause muscle cramps and pain.
- **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Low levels of potassium, calcium, or [[magnesium]] can contribute to muscle pain.
- **Psychological Factors:** Stress, [[anxiety]], and [[Depression]] can manifest as muscle tension and discomfort.

### Diagnosis:
- **Medical History:** Review of symptoms, physical activity, and medication use.
- **Physical Examination:** Assessment of pain location, tenderness, and muscle strength.
- **Laboratory Tests:** [[Blood]] tests to check for inflammation, infection, or metabolic issues.
- **Imaging Studies:** MRI or [[ultrasound]] in some cases to visualize muscle and tissue conditions.

### Treatment:
- **Rest:** Allowing affected muscles to recover.
- **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., [[ibuprofen]], [[acetaminophen]]).
- **Physical Therapy:** Stretching and strengthening exercises may be recommended.
- **Hydration and Nutrition:** Ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake.
- **Management of Underlying Conditions:** Treating infections, adjusting medications, or addressing chronic diseases.

### Prognosis:
- **Varies based on the underlying cause and severity.** 
- **Many cases of myalgia are self-limiting and resolve with appropriate care.** 
- **Chronic conditions may require ongoing management to control symptoms.**
