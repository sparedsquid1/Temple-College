The nurse is assessing a client in the PACU following surgery. The nurse notes the client received an anesthetic agent via a special vaporizer to prevent which reaction? A) Gastric upset B) Respiratory tract irritation C) Cardiac dysrhythmias D) Hypoxemia Answer: B Rationale: Desflurane is a volatile liquid that must be administered with a special vaporizer because delivery to the client without a vaporizer can result in irritation of the client's respiratory tract. It is the only agent which must use this special vaporizer. Some anesthetics will cause gastric upset and some preanesthetic agents are used to prevent this. Fentanyl can cause cardiac dysrhythmias and nitrous oxide can lead to hypoxemia. However, none of these agents require the vaporizer.

A nurse working in an outpatient surgical setting may see which general anesthetic agent administered via inhalation? A) Sevoflurane B) Desflurane C) Isoflurane D) Propofol Answer: A Rationale: A nurse working in an outpatient surgical setting may see sevoflurane used in outpatient general anesthesia. Propofol is used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Desflurane and isoflurane are volatile liquids which are also used for anesthesia.

The nurse is preparing a client for minor surgery in the lower extremity. The nurse will explain to the client that regional anesthesia will be used for the procedure and placed in which location in the body? A) In the veins B) In the arteries C) In the nerves D) In the capillaries Answer: C Rationale: Regional anesthesia involves injection around the client's nerves. Doing so prevents these nerves from sending pain signals to the brain. Regional anesthesia is never injected into the veins, arteries, or capillaries. General anesthesia can be injected in the veins.

A client admitted to a local health care facility is to undergo surgery with spinal anesthesia. Which actions is the nurse most likely to assess when caring for this client? A) Moderate muscle relaxation B) Loss of feeling in the lower abdomen C) Hypotension as anesthesia deepens D) Increase in the client's heart rate Answer: B Rationale: Spinal anesthesia involves the injection of a local anesthetic drug into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. There is a loss of feeling (anesthesia) and movement in the lower extremities, lower abdomen, and perineum. Spinal anesthesia is not known to increase a client's heart rate. Spinal anesthesia also does not cause hypotension or moderate muscle relaxation. Sevoflurane may be responsible for hypotension. In general anesthesia, the medications will decrease the heart rate.

The nurse prepares to teach a client about methohexital. The nurse will explain to the client this drug will have which effect? A) Skeletal muscle relaxation B) Profound analgesia C) CNS depression D) Neuroleptanalgesia Answer: C Rationale: Methohexital is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate that depresses the CNS to produce hypnosis and anesthesia, but it does not produce analgesia. Skeletal muscle relaxation is caused by skeletal muscle relaxants, halothane, and enflurane. An anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia is produced by ketamine, which is a rapid-acting general anesthetic. Neuroleptanalgesia is caused by a combination of fentanyl and droperidol.

The nurse is preparing a client for surgery. Which action should the nurse prioritize before administering the preanesthetic agent? A) Explain postoperative client activities. B) Check the client every 5 to 15 minutes. C) Assess the respiratory status of the client. D) Admit the client to an appropriate unit. Answer: A Rationale: When caring for a client prescribed preanesthetic drugs, the nurse should demonstrate, describe, and explain postoperative client activities, such as deep breathing, coughing, and leg exercises. The nurse should check the client every 5 to 15 minutes for emergence from anesthesia, but this is done after the administration of anesthesia, not before. Assessing the respiratory status of the client and admitting the client to an appropriate unit are both postoperative interventions that a nurse should perform. Therefore, these are not performed before the administration of preanesthetic drugs and anesthesia.

A client has arrived for scheduled surgery. Before administering the prescribed preanesthetic agent, which action will the nurse prioritize? A) Review the client's surgical and anesthesia records. B) Position the client to prevent aspiration of vomitus and secretions. C) Check the chart for any abnormal laboratory test results. D) Check the airway for patency and assess the respiratory status. Answer: C Rationale: Before surgery and administering the preanesthetic, the nurse should check the client's chart for any abnormal laboratory test results. Reviewing the client's surgical and anesthesia records, positioning the client to prevent aspiration of vomitus and secretions, checking the airway for patency, and assessing the respiratory status are the postoperative responsibilities of the nurse.

The nurse is conducting a preadministration assessment of a 67-year-old client. The nurse will question the prescribed glycopyrrolate if which disorder is noted in the client history? A) Diabetes B) Hypotension C) Respiratory problems D) Myocardial ischemia Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should confirm that the 53-year-old client does not have myocardial ischemia to ensure that the use of glycopyrrolate is not contraindicated. The other conditions that contraindicate the drug's use include prostatic hypertrophy and glaucoma. Diabetes, hypotension, or respiratory problems are not contraindications for the use of glycopyrrolate.

A client shares with a nurse the history of a recent tooth extraction. The nurse determines the client had which type of anesthesia after further questioning of the client? A) Regional anesthesia B) General anesthesia C) Topical anesthesia D) Local infiltration anesthesia Answer: D Rationale: Local infiltration anesthesia is often used for dental procedures. Regional anesthesia covers a larger area than that covered by local infiltration anesthesia, so it is not used for minor surgeries like that of a tooth extraction. General anesthesia is used to achieve a pain-free state for the entire body and is not the most appropriate type of anesthesia for a tooth extraction. Similarly, topical anesthesia is used to desensitize skin or mucous membranes for injection of a deeper local anesthetic.

A nursing instructor is teaching a group of nursing students about the various types of anesthesia. The instructor determines the teaching is successful when the students correctly choose which factor as influencing the type of anesthesia used? A) Gender of the client B) Length of surgical procedure C) Preanesthetic drug prescribed D) Postoperative care involved Answer: B Rationale: The choice of general anesthesia depends on factors that include the general physical condition of the client; the area, organ, or system being operated on; and the anticipated length of the surgical procedure. The selection of general anesthesia does not depend on the gender of the client, the preanesthetic drug prescribed for the client, or the postoperative care involved.

The nurse is preparing a client for surgery which will include endotracheal intubation. The nurse will include information about which drugs in the discussion? A) Benzodiazepines B) Barbiturates C) Opioid analgesics D) Skeletal muscle relaxants Answer: D Rationale: Skeletal muscle relaxants help produce relaxation of skeletal muscles during certain types of surgeries involving the chest or abdomen and are used to facilitate the insertion of an endotracheal tube. Barbiturates are used for the induction of anesthesia. Benzodiazepines are used to relieve anxiety, induce anesthesia, and consciously sedate the client before minor procedures. Opioid analgesics are used to produce neuroleptanalgesia characterized by general quietness, reduced motor activity, and profound analgesia.
