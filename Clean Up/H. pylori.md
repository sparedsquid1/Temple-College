**Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)** is a type of bacteria that infects the stomach. It is a common cause of peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, and can increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Infection and Transmission**: H. pylori is typically acquired during childhood and can persist throughout life unless treated. It is believed to spread through contaminated food, water, or direct contact with saliva, vomit, or fecal matter from an infected person.

2. **Symptoms**: Many people with H. pylori infection are asymptomatic. However, those who do have symptoms may experience:
   - Abdominal pain or discomfort
   - Bloating
   - Nausea
   - Frequent burping
   - Loss of appetite
   - Unintentional weight loss

3. **Diagnosis**: There are several methods to diagnose H. pylori infection, including:
   - Urea breath test
   - Stool antigen test
   - [[Blood]] antibody test (less commonly used now)
   - Endoscopy with biopsy

4. **Treatment**: The treatment for H. pylori usually involves a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and [[Proton pump inhibitors]] (PPIs) to reduce stomach acid, helping heal the stomach lining. A common regimen might include:
   - Two different antibiotics (such as [[clarithromycin]] and [[amoxicillin]] or [[metronidazole]])
   - A PPI (such as [[omeprazole]], [[lansoprazole]], or [[esomeprazole]])

5. **Prevention**: To reduce the risk of H. pylori infection, it is recommended to:
   - Practice good hygiene, such as regular handwashing with soap and water
   - Ensure food is properly prepared and cooked
   - Drink water from a safe, clean source

H. pylori infection is highly treatable, and successful eradication significantly reduces the risk of associated gastric diseases.
