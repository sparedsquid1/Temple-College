Dosage Calculation Exam: Students are required to pass a Dosage Calculation Exam (with a grade of “75%” or better) during the first semester of clinical coursework. The Dosage Calculation exam is scheduled for September 10 th , following Interprofessional Education (IPE). Dosage Calculation Exams may not be taken early. Students are expected to be present for all scheduled exams and will not be allowed into the testing area once the exam has started. A student who makes a grade below “75%” will be required to complete a remediation program as assigned by course faculty before the scheduled retake/make-up exam. This will be documented on a remediation form. Failure to complete and show proof of remediation will fail clinical. Students will have a maximum of 2 attempts to pass the dosage calculation exam but are expected to succeed on their first attempt. A student who does not pass the exam on the first attempt will be required to complete a remediation program a second and final time before attempting the exam. If a student is absent for any dosage calculation exam attempts, they will not be allowed to make this up and will count as a “0” grade. Failure to complete and show proof of remediation will fail VNSG 1460: Clinical-LVN 6 | P a g e Training II. A student who is absent on the day of testing will be required to take the retake/make-up exam. Absences for any of the exam attempts count as an attempt (Ex: Absent for 1 st exam, only 1 attempt remains). ** If a student fails to make a “75%” or better on the retake/makeup Dosage Calculation exam, the student will fail VNSG 1460: Clinical-LVN Training II**. A grade of “75%” is the highest score a student can receive on the retake/make- up exams. Students who pass the retake/makeup exam will receive a grade of 75, which will count as 10% of the clinical grade. Mandatory Skills Fair: A Skills Fair is scheduled on August 23 rd or 30 th. The purpose of this event is to practice skills you have already learned and gain confidence before returning to clinical. This is a mandatory requirement. VNSG 1331 Advanced Nursing Skills Course as Co-Requisite for VNSG 1460: Clinical -LVN Training II Course: VNSG 1331: Advanced Nursing Skills Course is a co-requisite for VNSG 1460: Clinical LVN-Training II Course. Skill check-offs of medication administration and intravenous catheterization (IV) insertion and removal are required components of VNSG 1460. Therefore, failure in VNSG 2331 will also result in the failure of VNSG 1460. VNSG 1331 Skills Checkoffs: Students will have the opportunity to practice each skill before checking off on that skill. Students will have a maximum of 3 attempts to check off on check off but are expected to succeed on their first attempt. Some open lab times will be available for students who feel they need extra practice time outside the required practice times. A student who does not pass a skill on the first attempt will be required to complete a remediation program before attempting the skill a second time. A student who does not pass a skill on the second attempt will be required to complete a remediation program before attempting the skill a third time. 7 | P a g Remediation and re-check times will be assigned and may include Mondays through Thursdays from 9:00-6:00. If a student is absent for any check-off attempts, they will not be allowed to make this up and will count as an attempt. Remediation is required prior to students’ subsequent checkoff(s). Failure to complete the remediation process will result in the failure of VNSG 1240: Clinical- LVN Training II. Students MUST PASS all skills to pass VNSG 1331: Advanced Nursing Skills AND VNSG 1240: Clinical-LVN Training II to continue in the VN Program.
