**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. The kidneys are essential for filtering waste products and excess fluids from the [[Blood]], which are then excreted in the urine. When kidney function declines, waste builds up in the body, leading to various health problems.

### **Stages of CKD**
CKD is classified into five stages based on the [[Glomerular filtration rate]] ([[Glomerular filtration rate]]), a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering [[Blood]]:

1. **Stage 1:** Kidney damage with normal or increased [[Glomerular filtration rate]] (90 mL/min or higher).
2. **Stage 2:** Mild decrease in [[Glomerular filtration rate]] (60-89 mL/min).
3. **Stage 3:** Moderate decrease in [[Glomerular filtration rate]] (30-59 mL/min). 
   - 3a: [[Glomerular filtration rate]] 45-59 mL/min
   - 3b: [[Glomerular filtration rate]] 30-44 mL/min
4. **Stage 4:** Severe decrease in [[Glomerular filtration rate]] (15-29 mL/min).
5. **Stage 5:** Kidney failure ([[Glomerular filtration rate]] less than 15 mL/min), requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.

### **Symptoms**
Early stages may not present noticeable symptoms. As CKD progresses, symptoms may include:
- Fatigue
- Swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, feet, or hands
- Shortness of breath
- Difficulty concentrating
- Nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Muscle cramps
- Changes in urine output and appearance
- Itchy skin
- High [[Blood]] pressure

### **Causes**
The most common causes of CKD include:
- **Diabetes**: High [[Blood]] sugar levels can damage [[Blood]] vessels in the kidneys.
- **Hypertension (High [[Blood]] Pressure)**: Can cause damage to the [[Blood]] vessels in the kidneys over time.
- **Glomerulonephritis**: Inflammation of the kidney's filtering units.
- **Polycystic Kidney Disease**: A genetic disorder causing cysts to form in the kidneys.
- **Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract**: Due to conditions like enlarged prostate or kidney stones.
- **Recurrent kidney infections**: [[pyelonephritis]] can lead to kidney damage.

### **Diagnosis**
CKD is diagnosed through:
- **[[Blood]] tests**: Measuring [[Glomerular filtration rate]] and checking for levels of waste products like creatinine.
- **Urine tests**: Checking for albumin or other signs of kidney damage.
- **Imaging**: [[ultrasound]] or CT scans to assess kidney structure.
- **Biopsy**: In some cases, a kidney biopsy might be needed to determine the cause of kidney damage.

### **Treatment**
Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of CKD and managing symptoms. This can include:
- **Medications**: To control [[Blood]] pressure, [[Blood]] sugar, and cholesterol levels.
- **Dietary changes**: Reducing salt, protein, and potassium intake.
- **Dialysis**: If CKD progresses to kidney failure.
- **Kidney transplant**: An option for some patients with end-stage kidney disease.

### **Prevention**
Preventing CKD involves managing the risk factors:
- **Control [[Blood]] pressure and diabetes**: Regular monitoring and medication adherence.
- **Healthy diet and regular exercise**: To maintain a healthy weight and cardiovascular health.
- **Avoid smoking**: Smoking can worsen kidney function.
- **Limit [[Alcohol]] intake**: Excessive [[Alcohol]] can harm the kidneys.
- **Regular check-ups**: Particularly for those with risk factors like diabetes or hypertension.
