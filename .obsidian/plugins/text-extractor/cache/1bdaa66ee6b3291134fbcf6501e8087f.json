A client with hypertension is prescribed clonidine. The nurse should question this order if which disorder is noted in the client's history? A) Active hepatic disease B) Active peptic ulcer C) Ulcerative colitis D) Mental depression Answer: A Rationale: The use of a centrally acting antiadrenergic drug is contraindicated in clients with active hepatic disease. The use of a centrally acting antiadrenergic drug is not contraindicated in clients with active peptic ulcer or ulcerative colitis. In clients with active peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or mental depression, the use of peripherally acting antiadrenergic drug is contraindicated. It is also contraindicated if the client is using MAOIs.

A client with a cardiac problem is treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Which reaction should the nurse point out as a generalized reaction that impacts the body when a beta-adrenergic blocking drug is given to the client? A) Vomiting B) Hyperglycemia C) Nausea D) Vertigo Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should identify vertigo as the generalized reaction that impacts the body when a beta-adrenergic blocking drug is given to the client. Vomiting, nausea, and hyperglycemia are not generalized reactions; they are gastrointestinal reactions that are observed when the client is administered beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 24 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Understand Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 295, Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Drugs 3. A client who is receiving a beta blocker tells the nurse about also taking ibuprofen for arthritis pain. The nurse would be alert for which reaction? A) Decreased effect of the beta blocker B) Increased risk of bradycardia C) Increased risk of paradoxical hypertensive effect D) Increase risk of hypotension Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should monitor for the decreased effect of the beta blocker in the client who is receiving a beta blocker along with NSAIDs. The nurse does not need to monitor for increased risk of bradycardia and paradoxical hypertensive effect or decreased risk of hypotension. There is an increase in the risk of paradoxical hypertensive effect when a beta-adrenergic blocking drug is administered with clonidine. There is an increase in the risk of bradycardia when a beta-adrenergic blocking drug is administered with antidepressants. There is an increased risk of hypotension when a beta-adrenergic blocking drug is administered with loop diuretics.

A nurse is caring for a client who has been prescribed propranolol for angina. After administering the drug, which action would the nurse do? A) Ask about relief of symptoms and record responses on the chart. B) Determine signs of infection in the client. C) Monitor for sudden decrease in urine output. D) Monitor for sudden increase in intraocular pressure. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should ask about the relief of symptoms and record the responses on the client's chart. Determining the signs of infection in the client is part of the nurse's preadministration assessment, not the ongoing assessment. The nurse does not need to monitor the client for a sudden decrease in urine output and a sudden increase in intraocular pressure for a client receiving propranolol therapy for angina.

A nurse is preparing to administer propranolol to a client for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The nurse checks the client's apical pulse rate and blood pressure before administration and notes that the pulse rate is 58 bpm. Which action would the nurse prioritize? A) Provide proper ventilation to the client. B) Delay drug administration for some time. C) Withhold the drug and contact health care provider. D) Immediately give oxygen via face mask. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should withhold the drug and contact the primary health care provider if the pulse rate of the client is below 60 bpm. Providing proper ventilation to the client, delaying drug administration for some time, or providing oxygen support to the client would be inappropriate for this client.

A client with Parkinson disease has been using levodopa. The client is now prescribed labetalol for hypertension. Which finding should the nurse prioritize if noted on assessment? A) Decreased effect of levodopa B) Increased effect of adrenergic blocker C) Increased risk of levodopa toxicity D) Decreased risk of psychotic behavior Answer: A Rationale: When levodopa and adrenergic blockers are administered together, the effect of the levodopa is decreased. Therefore, the client's Parkinson disease may not be controlled as effectively as before. The effect of the adrenergic blocker is not increased, nor is the risk for levodopa toxicity. The client is not experiencing psychotic behavior.

A nurse is caring for a client with an arrhythmia. Which assessment would the nurse prioritize for a client with a life-threatening arrhythmia who is receiving an adrenergic blocking drug intravenously? A) Perform continuous cardiac monitoring. B) Obtain pulse rate readings every 2 to 3 hours. C) Assess respiratory rate every hour. D) Obtain blood pressure readings every 15 minutes. Answer: A Rationale: The client with a life-threatening arrhythmia may receive an adrenergic blocking drug, such as propranolol, by the intravenous (IV) route. When these drugs are administered IV, cardiac monitoring is necessary. Clients not in a monitored unit are usually transferred to one as soon as possible. When these drugs are administered for a life-threatening arrhythmia, it is important to monitor the client continually with cardiac, blood pressure, and respiratory rate monitoring frequently.

A client with hypertension has been receiving nadolol and is now reporting dizziness on standing. The nurse notes a significant drop in blood pressure when checking it lying, sitting, and standing. Which nursing diagnoses should the nurse conclude is most appropriate for this client's plan of care? A) Injury Risk B) Ineffective Tissue Perfusion C) Impaired Comfort D) Decreased Cardiac Output Answer: A Rationale: The client is experiencing orthostatic hypotension, placing the client at risk for falls and injury, thus Injury Risk would be most appropriate. Ineffective Tissue Perfusion would be appropriate if the client was experiencing more rapid changes in blood pressure and/or changes in pulse and heart rate. Impaired Comfort would apply if the client was reporting other adverse reactions such as dry mouth or constipation. There is no information provided that would suggest decreased cardiac output.

A client is asking how alpha adrenergic blocking medications work. Which is the nurse's best response? A) “They relax the smooth muscle of blood vessels by vasodilatation.” B) “They cause vasoconstriction of the smooth muscle of blood vessels.” C) “They cause an increase in the heart rate.” D) “They decrease cardiac workload and oxygen consumption.” Answer: A Rationale: Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic nerves results in vasoconstriction. If stimulation of alpha adrenergic nerves is interrupted or blocked, the result is vasodilatation. Alpha adrenergic blocking medications cause vasodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle of the blood vessels. Alpha adrenergic blocking medications do not increase the heart rate or decrease cardiac workload and oxygen consumption.

Prior to administration of adrenergic blocking drug for hypertension, which should the nurse assess first? A) Temperature B) Blood pressure C) Laboratory values D) Pain assessment Answer: B Rationale: Establish an accurate database before any adrenergic blocking medication is administered for the first time. The client has a hypertensive disease and blood pressure and pulse should be taken on both arms in sitting, standing, and supine positions. Temperature, laboratory value and pain assessment are not warrant prior to the administration of an adrenergic blocking medication.

After teaching a group of nursing students about sympatholytic drugs, the instructor determines that the teaching was successful when the students correctly choose which groups as an example? Select all that apply. A) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors B) Alpha-adrenergic blockers C) Beta-adrenergic blockers D) Angiotensin receptor blockers E) Loop diuretics Answer: B, C Rationale: Alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers are classified as sympatholytic drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin receptor blockers block vasoconstriction effect of renin-angiotensin system and release of aldosterone. Loop diuretics inhibit reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the kidney. Loop diuretics should be used cautiously with beta-adrenergic blockers as there is an increased risk of hypotension with the combination.
