#### Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

**Conversion reaction** :: a defensive mechanism converting [[anxiety]] into a physical symptom.
<!--SR:!2024-07-03,2,230-->
A loss or decrease in physical function that cannot be explained by any known medical disorder.  
Paralysis and blindness are common manifestations and commonly linked to deep denial (e.g. going blind after watching porn).
Adolescent and young adulthood is usual ages of onset.
Do not imply to patient they are "faking it".

**La belle indifference** :: is a term meaning that the patient may act as though they are not really concerned about the problem.
<!--SR:!2024-07-03,2,230-->
The patient experiences something that is so unacceptable as to cause whatever physical symptom in order to avoid the [[anxiety]] presented and relieves said [[anxiety]], this is referred to as **Primary Gain**.

**Secondary gain** is the extra benefits one may receive from suffering from the physical affliction (e.g. extra [[sympathy]], love, and financial benefits).
***Malingering** is a conscious effort to avoid unpleasant situations, NOT the same thing.  Patient IS faking.*
