A nurse is obtaining the medication history of a client who is to start acyclovir. The nurse discovers this client is currently taking theophylline. The nurse should question the use of acyclovir due to which contraindication? A) Increases the risk for acyclovir toxicity B) Increases the risk of seizures in clients with respiratory problems C) Increases serum level of theophylline in clients taking theophylline D) Increased serum levels of antiviral valacyclovir Answer: C Rationale: When clients receiving theophylline treatment are administered acyclovir, there is an increase in the serum level of theophylline, thus placing the client at risk for theophylline toxicity. The serum levels of acyclovir do not increase. Increased levels of valacyclovir occur if the client is taking valacyclovir, not theophylline. Taking acyclovir with theophylline does not increase the risk of seizures.

The nurse monitoring a client receiving saquinavir assesses the client for responses. Which reaction requires priority response? A) Increase in client's weight B) Evidence of liver dysfunction C) Photosensitivity D) Allergic skin reaction Answer: A Rationale: Clients taking saquinavir experience redistribution of body fat, with the movement to the center of the body. The nurse should spend time with these clients, encouraging them to verbalize their feelings regarding this change in appearance. Taking saquinavir does not cause liver dysfunction, photosensitivity, or any allergic skin reactions.

The nurse is preparing discharge planning and education for a client who will continue antiviral therapy at home. Which points should the nurse include in the teaching session? A) “A slight elevation in temperature is normal and needn't be reported.” B) “Double the dosage of the drug if you miss a dose.” C) “Stop taking the drug as soon as the symptoms of the infection disappear.” D) “Make sure to notify your primary health care provider if you develop any adverse reactions.” Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to report adverse reactions to the primary health care provider. The nurse should also tell the client to report any increase in temperature, even if it is a slight increase. If the client misses a dose, the next dose should be taken as soon as remembered, but it should not be doubled. The nurse should also instruct the client to take the drug exactly as directed for the full course of therapy, even if the symptoms of the infection disappear.

The nurse notes a 25-year-old female client who is to begin antiretroviral therapy is currently taking oral contraceptives. The nurse should point out the combination can result in which interaction? A) Decreased effectiveness of antiviral therapy B) Increased risk of vaginal bleeding C) Decreased effectiveness of birth control pills D) Increased serum level of the antiretroviral Answer: C Rationale: Antiretrovirals decrease the effectiveness of oral birth control agents. Combining antiretrovirals with birth control pills does not, however, increase the risk of vaginal bleeding, increase serum levels of the antiretroviral, or decrease the effectiveness of antiviral therapy.

An HIV-positive client is being treated with didanosine as part of the antiretroviral therapy. When assessing the client, the nurse would immediately report which finding to the primary health care provider? A) Peripheral neuropathy B) Headache C) Excoriation D) Taste alteration Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should immediately report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy to the primary health care provider. Headache and taste alteration are some of the mild adverse effects of the drug and are not cause for immediate concern. Excoriation is an adverse effect of imiquimod and does not occur in clients being administered didanosine.

A client with skin lesions due to a viral infection has been prescribed a topical antiviral agent. When teaching the client about this therapy, which factor would the nurse emphasize? A) The drug will not prevent the spread of the disease to others. B) Topical drugs should be applied using the hand, not a finger cot or gloves. C) All lesions should be left open and not covered in any way. D) Sexual contact when lesions are present is permissible if barrier methods are used. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should inform the client that application of the drug does not prevent the spread of the disease to others. Topical drugs should be applied with a finger cot or gloves but not with bare hands. The nurse should instruct the client to cover all lesions and not leave them open. The nurse should also stress the importance of avoiding sexual contact when lesions are present irrespective of contraceptive measures.

An HIV-positive client on antiretroviral therapy asks the nurse about taking sildenafil. The nurse informs the client that which reaction may be experienced when combining sildenafil and antiretroviral therapy? A) Feeling of dizziness B) Itching of skin C) Risk of hypotension D) Depression Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should educate the client regarding the associated risks, such as hypotension, visual disturbances, and prolonged penile erection. Feeling of dizziness, itching of skin, and depression are not conditions that are specifically associated with sildenafil and antiretroviral drugs.

The nurse is preparing a client who is receiving antiretroviral therapy for discharge. Which precautions should the nurse point out to reduce the effects of photosensitivity? A) Wear protective clothing when outside. B) Increase fluid intake. C) Avoid lights while indoors. D) Use tanning beds for tan. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should encourage the client to wear protective clothing while going out in the sun to reduce the effect of photosensitivity. While increasing the fluid intake is recommended, it does not help combat the effects of photosensitivity. There is no need to avoid indoor lights as the skin becomes sensitive to sunlight but not indoor lights. The use of tanning beds should be avoided.

A client is to be discharged with a prescription for both zanamivir and a bronchodilator. Which instruction would the nurse include in the teaching plan for the client? A) Zanamivir should be taken every 6 hours. B) Use the bronchodilator before taking zanamivir. C) Zanamivir used with a bronchodilator causes orthostatic hypotension. D) Risk of disease transmission is minimal during therapy. Answer: B Rationale: The bronchodilator should be used before the zanamivir. The drug should be taken every 12 hours, not every 6 hours. The nurse should also inform the client that treatment with this drug does not decrease the risk of transmission of the “flu” to others. Zanamivir when used with a bronchodilator does not specifically cause orthostatic hypotension, though antivirals are known to affect the mental status of clients.

A nursing instructor is explaining the different categories of antiretroviral agents used in treatment for HIV infection. The instructor determines that the teaching was successful when the students choose which category as affecting an enzyme so that new viral particles cannot mature? A) Protease inhibitors B) Reverse transcriptase inhibitors C) Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors D) Integrase inhibitors Answer: A Rationale: Protease inhibitors block the protease enzyme so the new viral particles cannot mature. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors block the reverse transcriptase enzyme so the HIV material cannot change into DNA in the new cell, preventing new HIV copies from being created. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors latch on to the reverse transcriptase molecule to block the ability to make viral DNA. Integrase inhibitors prevent enzymes from inserting HIV genetic material into the cell's DNA.

A client is prescribed entecavir, which is supplied as a buffered powder. The nurse instructs the client to mix the powder with substance? A) Fruit juice B) Applesauce C) Water D) Gelatin Answer: C Rationale: The client should be instructed to mix the buffered powder with 4 oz of water (not juice), stir until it is dissolved, and then drink it immediately. Using any other substance such as fruit juice, applesauce, or gelatin would be inappropriate. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 11 Learning Objective: 5 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 137, Risk for Malnutrition 13. A client diagnosed with HIV infection is receiving HAART. On assessment, the nurse notes the client is alert and oriented, with reports of anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; 10-pound weight loss in past 6 weeks; pale, pink skin with irritation or breakdown; and without report of pain Which nursing diagnosis is a priority for this client? A) Injury Risk B) Risk Malnutrition: Less Than Body Requirements C) Risk for Altered Skin Integrity D) Acute Pain Answer: B Rationale: The client's report along with the weight loss strongly suggests a nursing diagnosis of Risk for Malnutrition: Less Than Body Requirements as a priority. The client is alert and oriented, so the Injury Risk is significantly low. There is no evidence of Altered Skin Integrity at present. However, this may become a concern if the client begins to experience skin breakdown secondary to his poor nutritional status. The client denies any pain, so Acute Pain would be inappropriate.
