In addition, clinical judgment should be used when selecting needles to administer injectable vaccines. Route Age Needle gauge and length Injection site Subcutaneous injection All ages 23–25-gauge 5/8 inch (16 mm) Thigh for infants younger than 12 months of age1; upper outer triceps area for persons 12 months of age and older Intramuscular injection Neonate, 28 days and younger 22–25-gauge 5/8 inch (16 mm2) Vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh Infants, 1–12 months 22–25-gauge 1 inch (25 mm) Vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh Toddlers, 1–2 years 22–25-gauge 1–1.25 inches (25–32 mm) Vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh3 22–25-gauge 5/82–1 inch (16–25 mm) Deltoid muscle of arm Children, 3–10 years 22–25-gauge 5/82–1 inch (16–25 mm) Deltoid muscle of arm3 22–25-gauge 1–1.25 inches (25–32 mm) Vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh Children, 11–18 years 22–25-gauge 5/82–1 inch (16–25 mm) Deltoid muscle of arm3,5 Adults, 19 years and older  130 lbs (60 kg) or less  130–152 lbs (60–70 kg)  Men, 152–260 lbs (70–118 kg)  Women, 152–200 lbs (70–90 kg)  Men, 260 lbs (118 kg) or more  Women, 200 lbs (90 kg) or more 22–25-gauge 1 inch (25 mm4) 1 inch (25 mm) 1–1.5 inches (25–38 mm) 1–1.5 inches (25–38 mm) 1.5 inches (38 mm) 1.5 inches (38 mm) Deltoid muscle of arm3,5 1 May be administered into the upper outer triceps area if necessary 2 If the skin is stretched tightly and subcutaneous tissues are not bunched 3 Preferred site 4 Some experts recommend a 5/8-inch needle for men and women weighing less than 60 kg, if used, skin must be stretched tightly and subcutaneous tissues must not be bunched. 5 The vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh can also be used. Most adolescents and adults will require a 1- to 1.5-inch (25–38 mm) needle to ensure intramuscular administration. Vaccines must reach the desired tissue to provide an optimal immune response and reduce the likelihood of injection-site reactions.
