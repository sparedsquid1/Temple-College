Hyperuricemia is a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of uric acid in the [[Blood]]. Uric acid is a waste product formed from the breakdown of purines, which are found in certain foods and are also produced by the body. Normally, uric acid is dissolved in the [[Blood]], processed by the kidneys, and excreted in the urine. However, when the body produces too much uric acid or the kidneys do not excrete enough, it can lead to hyperuricemia.

### Symptoms:
Hyperuricemia itself may not cause any symptoms, but it can lead to conditions such as gout and kidney stones, which have their own symptoms:

- **Gout:**
  - Sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and tenderness in joints, often the big toe
  - Swelling and warmth in the affected joint
- **Kidney Stones:**
  - Severe pain in the back or side
  - [[Blood]] in the urine
  - Frequent urination
  - Nausea and vomiting

### Causes:
- **Increased Production of Uric Acid:**
  - High purine diet (e.g., red meat, shellfish, certain alcoholic beverages)
  - Obesity
  - Certain genetic disorders
  - High cell turnover diseases (e.g., [[Leukemia]], [[Lymphoma]])
- **Decreased Excretion of Uric Acid:**
  - Kidney dysfunction or disease
  - Certain medications (e.g., [[Diuretics]], low-dose [[aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)]])
  - [[Alcohol]] consumption
  - Dehydration
- **Combination of Both:**
  - Conditions like metabolic syndrome, which includes hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Blood]] Test:**
  - Measurement of uric acid levels in the [[Blood]]
- **Urine Test:**
  - Measurement of uric acid excretion in the urine over 24 hours

### Treatment:
- **Medications:**
  - **Urate-Lowering Therapies:** [[allopurinol]], [[febuxostat]] (reduce uric acid production)
  - **Uricosuric Agents:** [[probenecid]] (increase uric acid excretion)
  - **Anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]:** [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]], [[colchicine]], [[Corticosteroids]] (for gout flare-ups)
- **Diet and Lifestyle Changes:**
  - Limiting intake of purine-rich foods and beverages
  - Reducing [[Alcohol]] consumption
  - Maintaining a healthy weight
  - Staying hydrated
- **Managing Underlying Conditions:**
  - Treating hypertension, diabetes, and [[hyperlipidemia]]

### Prognosis:
- **Good with Proper Management:**
  - Hyperuricemia can be controlled with medication and lifestyle modifications.
- **Complications:**
  - Untreated hyperuricemia can lead to recurrent gout attacks, chronic joint damage, kidney stones, and potentially chronic kidney disease.

### Prevention:
- **Dietary Adjustments:**
  - Reducing purine intake, limiting [[Alcohol]], and avoiding high-fructose corn syrup
- **Healthy Lifestyle:**
  - Regular exercise, weight management, and adequate hydration
- **Regular Monitoring:**
  - For individuals with risk factors, regular check-ups and [[Blood]] tests to monitor uric acid levels are advisable.

Proper management of hyperuricemia can prevent complications and improve quality of life for affected individuals.
