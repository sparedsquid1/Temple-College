Pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that specifically affects the kidneys. It occurs when bacteria ascend from the lower urinary tract to the kidneys, leading to inflammation and infection. Symptoms may include [[Fever]], chills, flank pain (pain in the side or back), nausea, vomiting, and painful urination. If left untreated, pyelonephritis can lead to serious complications, such as kidney damage or sepsis. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to eliminate the infection and, in some cases, addressing any underlying issues that might have contributed to the infection.
