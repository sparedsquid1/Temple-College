### Generic name
`= this.file.name`

### Drug class 
`= this.DrugClass`
	`= this.DrugClass.KindleLinkChap`

### Contraindications
See `= this.DrugClassContra`

### Mechanisms of Action
**Lansoprazole Mechanism of Action (MOA):**  
Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production. It works by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells. This enzyme, often called the proton pump, is responsible for secreting hydrogen ions into the stomach lumen. By blocking this pump, lansoprazole suppresses the [[Final]] step of acid production, leading to reduced gastric acidity. It is activated in the acidic environment of the stomach and binds covalently to the enzyme.

### Explanation:

- **Intermediate Complexity Scope:** Focuses on the molecular target (H+/K+ ATPase) and its functional role in acid secretion, avoiding overly technical details such as specific binding dynamics while still covering irreversible inhibition and the drug's site of activation.
