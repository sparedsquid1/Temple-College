A client is admitted to the emergency department with a severe headache, nausea, shortness of breath, and blood pressure of 200/120 mm Hg. Which response should the nurse prioritize? A) Take a blood pressure every 30 minutes. B) Alternate the arms for assessing the blood pressure and pulse. C) Continuously monitor the client's status. D) Measure the pulse rate every hour. Answer: C Rationale: When the client has a severe hypertensive emergency (such as an extremely elevated blood pressure), does not have the expected response to drug therapy, or is critically ill, continuous monitoring is performed. The alarm should be set to alert the medical staff if the blood pressure continues to rise. The client is at risk of developing serious complications such as a stroke, kidney failure, or retinopathy if the blood pressure is not lowered quickly.

A client presents to the urgent care clinic reporting severe dizziness. On assessment, the nurse learns the client was recently prescribed losartan and quit taking it thinking it was responsible for the dizziness. Which assessment should the nurse prioritize? A) Breathing difficulty B) Rebound hypertension C) Orthostatic hypotension D) Anginal attacks Answer: B Rationale: Rebound hypertension will occur in clients when antihypertensives are abruptly discontinued. In rebound hypertension, there is a sudden rise in blood pressure when the antihypertensives are withheld. Orthostatic hypotension, anginal attacks, and breathing difficulty are the adverse reactions associated with antihypertensive drug usage and may not occur on stopping the drug.

The nurse is teaching a client with hypertension about losartan which the health care provider has prescribed. The nurse can explain that losartan exerts which action on the body? A) Blocks aldosterone receptors B) Prevents conversion of angiotensin I C) Blocks angiotensin II receptors D) Prevents renin secretion Answer: C Rationale: Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, acting to block the angiotensin II receptors. By blocking the angiotensin II receptor, the renin– angiotensin system is stopped and consequently blood pressure is reduced. Drugs such as captopril prevent the conversion of angiotensin I. A new drug type—direct renin inhibitors—will inhibit renin and subsequently prevent the angiotensin conversion process. A second newer drug type is selective aldosterone receptor antagonists (SARAs), which blocks the angiotensin process by binding with aldosterone.

The nurse is assessing a client with renal disease and discovers the client's blood pressure has increased since the last visit. The nurse suspects the client has developed which concern? A) Essential hypertension B) Secondary hypertension C) Rebound hypertension D) Hypertensive emergency Answer: B Rationale: In secondary hypertension, there is usually a known cause for the development of hypertension. Renal disease is one of the causes of secondary hypertension. When there is no known cause of hypertension, it is called essential hypertension. Rebound hypertension occurs when a client abruptly stops taking antihypertensive medication. Hypertensive emergency is a high blood pressure state, which has to be lowered immediately.

After teaching a group of nursing students on the mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) drugs, the instructor determines the session is successful after the students correctly choose which action as the result of aldosterone? A) Inhibits renin secretion B) Causes sodium and water retention C) Causes excess potassium retention D) Promotes angiotensin I conversion Answer: B Rationale: Aldosterone causes retention of sodium and water. This in turn causes a rise in blood pressure. ACEIs act by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Aldosterone does not inhibit the release of renin and is not involved in the retention of potassium. Angiotensin-converting enzymes, and not aldosterone, are involved in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

A nurse notes a client has a new prescription for fluconazole who has also been administered losartan for several months. The nurse determines the client should be monitored for which result of this combination? A) Increased risk of adverse effects of losartan B) Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction C) Decreased hypotensive effect of losartan D) Increased risk of hypoglycemia Answer: A Rationale: Increased risk of antihypertensive effects and adverse reactions are associated with the concomitant use of fluconazole and losartan. Decreased hypotensive effect of losartan is seen with use of indomethacin and does not occur with the concomitant use of these drugs. Increased risk of hypoglycemia can occur when ACEIs and hypoglycemic agents and insulin are used concomitantly. There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity when allopurinol and ACEIs are used concomitantly.

A client is receiving a diuretic for the treatment of hypertension. Which assessment finding on the laboratory reports should the nurse prioritize? A) Hyperkalemia B) Hyponatremia C) Hypomagnesemia D) Hypocalcemia Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should assess for hyponatremia in clients receiving diuretics. Diuretic usage causes electrolyte disturbances such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia. The nurse should inform the primary health care provider if signs and symptoms of electrolyte imbalance occur. Hyperkalemia can occur with direct renin inhibitor medications. Hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia are not recognized adverse reactions to antihypertensive medications.

A client is prescribed clonidine as a transdermal patch. After instructing the client about this drug, the nurse determines that the teaching was successful when the client states that the patch should remain in place for how long? A) 24 hours B) 3 days C) 7 days D) 2 weeks Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should ensure that the transdermal patch is intact for a period of 1 week. A clonidine transdermal patch should be applied to a hairless area over the torso for 1 week. If the patch loosens before 7 days, it has to be reinforced. The nurse has to mark the date of placement and the date of removal of the patch on the surface of the patch.

A client, aged 60 years, is receiving nitroprusside for hypertensive emergency. The nurse would be alert for the development of which reaction? A) Significant hypotension B) Rebound hypertension C) Blindness D) Stroke Answer: A Rationale: An older adult client is at risk for significant hypotension when receiving nitroprusside. To prevent this, the dosage should be reduced during the initial period of therapy. Rebound hypertension can occur when an individual suddenly stops taking an antihypertensive medication. This puts extreme stress on target organs such as the heart, kidney, and eyes, which could result in a stroke or blindness in the client if not treated quickly.

A nurse is analyzing the medical records of several clients who have come to the clinic for a visit. The nurse determines that a client with which blood pressure readings would be identified as prehypertensive? A) 112/72 mm Hg B) 128/86 mm Hg C) 144/92 mm Hg D) 164/102 mm Hg Answer: B Rationale: Prehypertension is classified as a systolic blood pressure ranging between 120 and 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure ranging between 80 and 89 mm Hg. A systolic pressure below 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mm Hg are considered normal. Stage 1 hypertension would be characterized by a systolic pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure between 90 and 99 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension would be characterized by a systolic pressure of 160 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater.

The nursing mentor is supervising a group of nursing students in the clinic. The mentor determines the students are well prepared when they prioritize which assessment with clients receiving medications such as doxazosin? A) Pain rating B) Blood pressure monitoring C) Weight measurement D) Level of consciousness Answer: B Rationale: Doxazosin is an example of an antiadrenergic drug given to individuals for the treatment of hypertension. Although assessing for pain, measuring weight, and assessing for levels of consciousness are important, monitoring the client's blood pressure would have the highest priority because the drug therapy regimen may need to be adjusted or changed if the client's response is inadequate.

The nursing instructor is teaching a group of students about the various medications used to treat hypertension. After the session, the instructor determines the session is successful when the students correctly connect which action(s) with calcium channel blockers? Select all that apply. A) Relaxation of blood vessels B) Increased oxygen supply to the heart C) Reduced workload on the heart D) Decreased blood pressure E) Increased workload on the kidneys Answer: A, B, C, D Rationale: The use of calcium channel blockers results in relaxation of blood vessels, increased oxygen supply to the heart, reduced workload on the heart, and decreased blood pressure. The overall goal of treating hypertension is to help decrease the workload on the heart and kidneys. One of the dangers of a hypertensive crisis is kidney damage due to the increased workload.

The client with hypertension, who has been prescribed aliskiren, reports to the clinic not feeling well. Which assessment(s) finding should the nurse prioritize? Select all that apply. A) Heart rate above 100 beats per minute B) Fever greater than 100°F C) Swelling of the face D) Swelling of the throat E) Blood pressure above 170/100 mm Hg Answer: C, D Rationale: An adverse reaction to aliskiren is angioedema. Angioedema presents with swelling of the face, lips, throat, or extremities. The client should immediately call the health care provider to report the symptoms and get instructions regarding treatment. The increased heart rate, fever, and elevated blood pressure would be related to other sources and would also need to be investigated and treated appropriately; however, they are not indications of angioedema.

The nurse is conducting an ongoing assessment after the administration of an antihypertensive. About which finding(s) should the nurse prioritize notifying the primary health care provider? Select all that apply. A) Weight gain of 0.9 kg (2 lb) or more per day B) Headache C) Edema D) Insomnia E) Sedation Answer: A, C Rationale: The nurse should notify the primary health care provider if a client has a weight gain of 0.9 kg (2 lb) or more per day or edema of the hands, fingers, feet, legs, or sacral area. Sedation is a potential adverse reaction of clonidine, guanabenz, and methyldopate. A headache is a potential adverse reaction of many of the antihypertensives but does not warrant an emergent report to the health care provider. Insomnia is a potential adverse reaction to labetalol.

The nurse is teaching a client with hypertension about the prescribed transdermal clonidine. The nurse determines the session is successful when the client correctly articulates which instruction(s)? Select all that apply. A) A new patch is applied daily. B) If the patch loosens, a new patch should be applied. C) The use of the adhesive overlay is not necessary. D) A different body area should be selected for each application. E) The patch should be applied to a hairless area. Answer: D, E Rationale: The patch is applied to a hairless area of intact skin on the upper arm or torso; the patch is kept in place for 7 days. The adhesive overlay is applied directly over the system to ensure the patch remains in place for the required time. A different body area is selected for each application. If the patch loosens before 7 days, the edges can be reinforced with nonallergenic tape. The date the patch was placed and the date the patch is to be removed can be written on the surface of the patch with a fiber-tipped pen.

An elderly client with hypertension is prescribed labetalol. Which instruction(s) should the nurse prioritize giving the client? Select all that apply. A) Sit on the bed for 1 or 2 minutes when rising from a lying position. B) Rise quickly from a chair when moving to a standing position. C) Take the antihypertensive less frequently if hypotension occurs. D) Have someone assist the client if dizziness or weakness occurs. E) Increase salt intake to counteract the hypotension. Answer: A, D Rationale: Some antihypertensive medications can cause orthostatic hypotension, which can lead to increased risk of falls. The nurse explains that when rising from a lying position, the client should sit on the edge of the bed for 1 or 2 minutes; the client should rise slowly from a chair and then stand for 1–2 minutes; and when symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur, someone assisting the client in getting out of bed or a chair can decrease the risk of falls due to orthostatic hypotension. The client should not decrease or change the dose without consulting with the health care provider first, as this may cause rebound hypertension. Increased sodium intake will not counteract hypotension but could increase the blood pressure leading to more adverse reactions.

The nurse is preparing to administer losartan to a client with hypertension. The nurse should question this order if which disorder(s) is noted in the client's medical record? Select all that apply. A) Bilateral stenosis B) Angioedema C) Pregnancy D) Diabetes E) Hyperlipidemia Answer: A, B, C Rationale: The use of ACEIs (such as benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril) and ARBs (such as azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, and valsartan/sacubitril) are contraindicated if the client has impaired renal function, heart failure, salt or volume depletion, bilateral stenosis, or angioedema or is pregnant. Diabetes is often the cause of secondary hypertension and necessitates treatment. Some of the antihypertensives are also used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. An elevation of various electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium is more of a concern than hyperlipidemia.

A nurse is preparing to teach a client about captopril, which has been prescribed to treat hypertension. Which instruction(s) should the nurse point out during this teaching session? Select all that apply. A) Taking the drug with meals to decrease GI upset B) Informing the client about the possibility of a cough C) Crushing the capsule before taking it D) Taking measures to reduce injury from hypotension E) Reporting any swelling of the face, throat, or extremities Answer: B, D Rationale: The client needs to know that some clients experience a dry cough that does not subside until drug therapy is discontinued and this reaction may need to be tolerated. In addition, these drugs may cause a significant drop in blood pressure after the first dose, so the client needs to take measures to reduce the risk of injury from the drug's effects. The ACE inhibitors, captopril and moexipril, should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals to enhance absorption. The drugs are sustained-release capsules that should not be crushed, opened, or chewed. ACEIs do not cause angioedema.

A client has a nursing diagnosis of activity intolerance related to fatigue and weakness. Which action(s) would be appropriate for the nurse to include in the client's plan of care? Select all that apply. A) Encouraging ambulation as tolerated B) Maintaining bed rest as much as possible C) Mandating the use of assistive devices D) Encouraging activities early in the morning when fatigue is less E) Promoting rest periods throughout the day as necessary Answer: A, E Rationale: The client is encouraged to walk and ambulate as they can tolerate. Assistive devices may be used if needed, but these should not be mandated for use. The client can gradually increase tolerance by increasing the daily amount of activity. Planning rest periods according to the individual's tolerance is appropriate. Rest can take many forms, such as sitting in a chair, napping, watching television, or sitting with legs elevated.
