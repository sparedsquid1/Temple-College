Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is ==a rare, congenital neurocutaneous disorder characterized by distinctive skin, brain, and eye abnormalities==. 

### Causes: 

SWS is caused by a mutation in the [[GNAQ gene]], which plays a role in the development and function of blood vessels. 

### Symptoms: 

#### Skin: 

- Port-wine birthmark (permanent, dark red birthmark) on one side of the face, typically affecting the forehead, upper eyelid, and cheek

#### Brain: 

- Angiomas (abnormal blood vessels) in the brain's lining (leptomeninges)

- Seizures, often focal (affecting one side of the body)

- Stroke-like episodes

- Cognitive and developmental delays

#### Eye: 

Glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye) and Buphthalmos (enlarged eye). 

#### Other: 

Seizures, Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), and Intellectual disability. 

### Diagnosis:

SWS is typically diagnosed based on the presence of the characteristic skin, brain, and eye findings. Imaging tests, such as MRI, can confirm the presence of brain [[angiomas]]. 

### Treatment:

Treatment for SWS is aimed at managing the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include: 

- Laser therapy to lighten the port-wine birthmark

- Anti-seizure medications

- Glaucoma medications

- Surgery to remove brain angiomas if they are causing seizures or other neurological problems

- Educational and behavioral interventions for cognitive and developmental delays 

### Prognosis: 

The prognosis for SWS varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms. Some individuals may have mild symptoms and live long, healthy lives, while others may experience severe complications and require significant medical care.
