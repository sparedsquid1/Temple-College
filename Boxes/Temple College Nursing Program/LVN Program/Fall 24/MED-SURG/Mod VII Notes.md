### **Chapter 55 Summary: Nursing Care of Patients with Burns**

#### **Burn Pathophysiology**

- **Mechanism**: Burns result from heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation transferring energy to the skin and underlying tissues.
- **Effects**:
    - Denatures cellular proteins.
    - Causes loss of protective skin function.
    - Increases risk for infection, fluid loss, and impaired temperature regulation.

---

#### **Classification of Burns**

1. **By Depth**:
    
    - **Partial-Thickness (Superficial)**: Epidermis and part of the dermis; pink/red, blanches, and heals in 7–10 days.
    - **Partial-Thickness (Deep)**: Epidermis and deeper dermis; blistering, painful, and heals in 14–21 days; may require grafting.
    - **Full-Thickness**: Epidermis, dermis, and underlying tissues; leathery texture, painless due to nerve destruction, requires grafting.
2. **By Extent**:
    
    - **Rule of Nines**: Divides the body into regions to estimate total body surface area (TBSA) affected.
3. **By Cause**:
    
    - **Thermal**: Flames, hot liquids.
    - **Chemical**: Acids, alkalis.
    - **Electrical**: Often full-thickness, can damage internal organs.
    - **Radiation**: Caused by industrial exposure or UV light.
