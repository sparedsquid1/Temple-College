Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved What is a virus?  A tiny infectious organism that enters the body, attaches to host cells, and uses the host cell to replicate by releasing its own DNA and RNA inside the cell  The host cell then releases more virus and the replicated viruses go and invade other cells  There are over 200 viruses that are known to produce diseases like: o Influenza o Warts o Cold sores o West Nile virus o Hepatitis C Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Drugs Used to Treat Viruses  Antiviral  Antiretroviral Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiviral Drugs—Actions  Combat viral infections  Target certain events that happen in the viral replication cycle which interfere with the virus’s ability to reproduce in a cell  Attempt to disable the protein part of the virus  Viruses can develop resistance  Development of antiviral drugs is difficult and expensive Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiviral Drugs—Uses  Used to treat some viral infections caused by: o Cytomegalovirus (CMV) such as retinitis o CMV prevention in transplant recipients o Hepatitis B and C o Influenza A and B o Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  Unlabeled uses o Prevention of CMV and HSV infections after transplantation procedures o Varicella pneumonia Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiviral Drugs—Practice Considerations  New viral infections evolve frequently (Ebola and coronaviruses)  New antivirals/antiretrovirals are constantly under development  Nurses need to rely on reference materials to see where progress is in the battle against viral infections Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antivirals—Adverse Reactions  Gastrointestinal System Reactions: o Nausea and vomiting o Diarrhea  Other Reactions: o Headache o Rash o Fever o Insomnia Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antivirals—Contraindications and Precautions  Contraindicated in clients: o with a history of allergies to the drug or other antivirals o Cidofovir should not be given to clients who have renal impairment or in combinations with medications that are nephrotoxic (aminoglycosides) o Ribavirin should not be used in clients with unstable cardiac disease o pregnancy (pregnancy category B and C) and lactation  Used cautiously in clients with: o Renal impairment o Low blood cell counts o History of epilepsy (rimantadine) o History of respiratory disease (zanamivir) o HBV (exacerbation of hepatitis after discontinuing adefovir dipivoxil or entecavir) Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antivirals—Interactions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved What is a retrovirus?  Retroviruses attack the host cell just like a virus except the difference that the RNA is the primary component of the virus  Contain reverse transcriptase that is used to turn the RNA of the virus into DNA—helps to produce more of the virus  Example: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  Retrovirus mutation happens more frequently  Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)—due to rapid mutation, a multidrug approach is often used Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretroviral Drugs—Actions  Entry inhibitors prevent the attachment or fusion of HIV to a host cell for initial entry  Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors latch on to the reverse transcriptase molecule and block the ability to make viral DNA  Integrase inhibitors prevent enzymes from inserting HIV genetic material into the cell’s DNA  Reverse transcriptase inhibitors block the reverse transcriptase enzyme so HIV material cannot change into DNA in the new cell—no new copies of HIV  Protease inhibitors block the protease enzyme so new viral particles cannot mature Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretroviral Drugs—Uses  Used to treat some viral infections caused by: o Hepatitis B o HIV o Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  Used to prevent HIV infection: o Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretroviral Drugs—Adverse Reactions  Gastrointestinal System Reactions: o Nausea and vomiting o Diarrhea o Altered taste  Other Reactions: o Headache, fever, chills o Rash o Numbness and tingling in the circumoral area, peripherally, or both Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretroviral Drugs—Contraindications and Precautions  Contraindicated in clients: o with a history of allergies to the drug or other antiretrovirals o who are lactating o who are taking medications that interact with the antiretroviral drugs  Used cautiously in clients with: o diabetes mellitus o hepatic impairment o history of bladder or kidney stone formation o older adults taking didanosine—increased risk of pancreatitis o sulfonamide allergy (fosamprenavir and amprenavir) Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretrovirals—Interactions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antiretrovirals—Interactions continued Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Pharmacology in Practice Exercise #1  Why are viruses so difficult to treat even with the use of antiviral medications?
