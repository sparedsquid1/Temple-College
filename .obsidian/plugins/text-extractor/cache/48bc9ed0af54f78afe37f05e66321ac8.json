Davis Company Practice Analysis Tip: Linking NCLEX-PN® to Practice ▪ The licensed practical nurse/licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN) will • Use transfer assistive devices (e.g., gait/transfer belt, slide board, mechanical lift). • Assist in the care of a client experiencing sensory/perceptual alterations. • Assure availability and safe functioning of client care equipment. • Evaluate the appropriateness of health-care provider (HCP) order for client. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Practice Analysis Tip: Linking NCLEX-PN® to Practice (continued) • Reconcile and maintain medication list or medication administration record (e.g., prescribed medications, herbal supplements, over-the-counter medications). Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map 32-year-old Sakae Li arrived at the emergency room with report of loss of sensation and weakness in both legs and feet. A lumbar puncture showed an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal white blood cell count. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelination. She was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map (continued_1) Her medical history is unremarkable except for a flu-like illness 2 weeks prior. Shortly after admission, the weakness progressed to her hands and arms. She required maximum assistance with her activities of daily living and good skin care to prevent pressure ulcers. She had an indwelling catheter inserted for urinary retention. She was closely observed for respiratory problems and blood pressure fluctuations. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map (continued_2) Eventually, as the weakness ascended to her upper body, she required intubation and enteral feedings. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map: Activity ▪ What nursing concepts would be used for Ms. Li’s case? ▪ Can you see how the concepts in Ms. Li’s care are related? ▪ Work with your group to create a concept map showing relationships between the concepts. ▪ Continue the map to show patient cues, nursing interventions, and collaborative relationships. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Ms. Li: Suggested Relationships Self-Care Perfusion Oxygenation Ms. Li Elimination Sensory Perception Potential for impaired tissue integrity Mobility Weakness Nutrition Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Activity: Cue Recognition 50.1 A patient with ALS reports that he is starting to cough and sneeze during meals. What should you do? Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Cue Recognition 50.1: Answer ▪ Make the patient NPO. ▪ Notify the HCP that the patient is at risk for aspiration. ▪ Collaborate with the speech therapist for swallowing assessment. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Cue Recognition 50.1: Answer Rationale As weakness progresses, patients with ALS may begin to have problems with swallowing, putting them at risk for aspiration. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Activity: Cue Recognition 50.2 The assistive personnel reports that her new patient with myasthenia gravis is too fatigued to take his shower this evening. What do you do? Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Cue Recognition 50.2: Answer ▪ Change the patient to a morning bath. ▪ Obtain a set of vital signs on the patient, listen to lung sounds, and collect data on any patient concerns to make sure there is no illness present. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Cue Recognition 50.2: Answer Rationale Patients with myasthenia gravis have more energy in the a.m. and more fatigue in the p.m. This may address the issue, but to be vigilant, make sure the patient does not have an illness that is causing an exacerbation. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study for SBAR Hand-Off Report You are caring for Mr. Borger who has multiple sclerosis and has had a recent decline in function. He has had multiple falls, so the registered nurse (RN) encouraged him to use his wheelchair when he goes to the dining room. The HCP has agreed to a physical therapy eval. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company SBAR Hand-Off Report: Activity ▪ You are preparing to give a hand-off to the physical therapist. ▪ Think about the information you should include in the hand-off report. ▪ Now turn to your neighbor and communicate a hand-off report using SBAR. ▪ Afterwards, review suggested SBAR report on next slide. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company SBAR Hand-Off Report: Suggested Answers Situation: Mr. Borger has multiple sclerosis and has had a decline in function. Background: Up until last week, Mr. Borger had been ambulating to the dining room independently. Assessment: He has had several falls and now needs to use a wheelchair to go down to the dining room. Recommendation: Mr. Borger needs therapy to continue to ambulate with an assistive device or to be fitted for a wheelchair. Copyright ©2023 F.A.
