The **endoderm** is the innermost of the three primary germ layers in the early embryo. It forms the lining of many internal organs and structures, particularly those related to the [[Respiratory]] and [[Digestive]] systems.

### **Functions and Derivatives of the Endoderm**
The endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of several vital organs and glands. Key structures derived from the endoderm include:

1. **[[Digestive]] System**:
   - **Lining of the gastrointestinal tract** (except the [[Mouth]] and anus, which are derived from [[Ectoderm]]).
   - **[[Liver]]** and **[[Pancreas]]**.
   - **Stomach**, **small intestine**, and **colon**.
   - **[[Gallbladder]]** and associated [[Bile]] ducts.

2. **[[Respiratory]] System**:
   - **Lining of the [[Respiratory]] tract**, including the **[[trachea]]**, **[[bronchi]]**, and **lungs**.

3. **Endocrine Glands**:
   - **Thyroid gland**.
   - **Parathyroid glands**.
   - **Thymus**.

4. **Urinary and Reproductive Systems**:
   - Parts of the **bladder** and **[[Urethra]]**.
   - **Lining of the [[Urinary system]]** (though some parts of the kidney system arise from [[Mesoderm]]).

5. **Auditory System**:
   - Lining of parts of the **middle ear** and **Eustachian tube**.

6. **Parts of the Pharynx and [[Tongue]]**:
   - **Tonsils**, **pharynx**, and **epithelial parts** of the **[[Tongue]]**.

The endoderm plays a crucial role in forming the internal linings and glandular structures that are essential for digestion, respiration, and hormone regulation. It forms much of the functional tissue within these organ systems.
