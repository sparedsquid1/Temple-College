An 80-year-old male client with chronic renal insufficiency is prescribed anabolic steroid therapy for the management of anemia associated with renal insufficiency. The nurse will carefully monitor the client for which potential disorder? A) Hypoglycemic attacks B) Serious cardiac disease C) Hypotensive shock D) Cancer of the prostate Answer: D Rationale: Elderly male clients undergoing anabolic steroid therapy are at an increased risk of developing cancer of the prostate gland. Therefore, anabolic steroid therapy needs to be administered cautiously in these clients. Hypoglycemic attacks, serious cardiac disease, and hypotensive shock are not seen in elderly clients on anabolic steroid therapy. Individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of developing hypoglycemia with the use of sulfonylureas and anabolic steroids if also given male hormones. Male hormones are contraindicated in clients with serious cardiac disease. Hypotensive shock can occur with the use of glucocorticoids.

A nurse is caring for a client with advanced breast cancer who is receiving androgen therapy. Which signs might alert the nurse to the possibility of liver toxicity? A) Edema of the feet B) Increase in appetite C) Clinical jaundice D) Increase in weight Answer: C Rationale: Liver toxicity is indicated by the presence of jaundice. Edema of the feet and an increase in weight may be seen because of fluid and electrolyte imbalance but does not indicate liver toxicity. An increase in appetite shows that the client is responding well to the drug and is not a sign of liver toxicity.

When caring for a client receiving estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms, the nurse documents a diagnosis of ineffective tissue perfusion. Which condition is the nurse prioritizing in the diagnosis? A) Thromboembolism B) Edema of the feet C) Gastrointestinal upset D) Chloasma Answer: A Rationale: The nursing diagnosis of ineffective tissue perfusion is related to thromboembolism, which is a complication of estrogen replacement therapy. A nurse may note other female hormone–related adverse reactions such as edema of the feet due to excess fluid volume or gastrointestinal upset, which manifests as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and bloating. Chloasma is a dermatologic reaction due to female hormones, which results in excessive pigmentation of the skin.

A client with delayed puberty has been advised to undertake transdermal androgen therapy. Which instructions should the nurse prioritize? A) Apply the ointment to the underside of the scrotum. B) Repeat the application to the scrotum after 3 days. C) Moisten the skin before the application. D) Apply immediately after removing the cover. Answer: D Rationale: Applying the system immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective cover may help obtain an optimal response to the transdermal androgen delivery system. The drug should not be applied to the underside of the scrotum. It is applied to clean, dry skin on the abdomen, thigh, back, or upper arm. Thus, the skin should not be moistened before the application; rather, it should be dry. Seven days should be allowed between applications to a specific site, and application to the same site should not be repeated after 3 days.

A female client receiving fluoxymesterone for metastatic breast cancer is disturbed by the physical changes seen in her body. The nurse provides support to the client based on assessment of which features the client is experiencing related to this therapy? A) Deepening of the voice B) Hypopigmentation of the skin C) Decrease in clitoris size D) Increase in body weight Answer: A Rationale: Deepening of the voice may be seen as a feature of virilization following male hormone therapy in a female client. Virilization is the acquisition of male characteristics in the female. Other features of virilization include pigmentation, and not hypopigmentation, of the skin and an increase, not a decrease, in the size of the clitoris. An increase in body weight is not a sign of virilization. It may occur due to impaired nutrition of the body.

A client taking oral contraceptive drugs reports occasional abdominal bloating. Which instruction should the nurse point out may be beneficial to help alleviate the condition? A) Limit fluid intake with meals. B) Take the drug along with food. C) Decrease the intake of salt. D) Elevate the legs when sitting. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to limit fluid intake with meals if they experience bloating of the abdomen after oral contraceptive use. Light to moderate exercise also may be helpful. Taking the drug with food alleviates nausea and GI irritation, and not the bloating of the abdomen. A decrease in salt intake causes a decrease in the intake of sodium, which may be beneficial when there is an excess fluid volume, and not when there is bloating of the abdomen. Elevating the legs when sitting prevents thromboembolism seen with oral contraceptive use. It does not prevent bloating of the abdomen.

A nurse is preparing a presentation for a young adult women's group about oral contraceptives and the risks. Which conditions would the nurse include as having an increased risk of developing when prescribed contraceptives? A) Fibrocystic breast disease B) Ovarian cysts C) Endometrial cancer D) Hepatic adenoma Answer: D Rationale: The risks of hepatic adenoma may be increased with the use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, thromboembolic disorders, strokes, visual disturbances, gallbladder disease, hypertension, and fetal abnormalities. The risks of fibrocystic breast disease, ovarian cysts, and endometrial cancer are decreased, not increased, with the use of oral contraceptives.

A client has a levonorgestrel implant contraceptive system inserted. The nurse understands that this type of contraceptive provides protection for how long? A) 1 year B) 3 years C) 5 years D) 7 years Answer: C Rationale: Levonorgestrel, a progestin, is available as an implant contraceptive system. Six capsules, each containing levonorgestrel, are implanted using local anesthesia in the subdermal tissues of the midportion of the upper arm. The capsules provide contraceptive protection for 5 years but may be removed at any time at the request of the client.

After explaining the various contraceptive options with a client, the client opts for the etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. After teaching the client about this choice, the nurse determines that the teaching was effective when the client makes which statement? A) “Once I insert the ring, it won't come out.” B) “The ring should stay in place for 3 weeks.” C) “When bleeding starts, that's the signal to change the ring.” D) “I can reuse the ring several times before discarding it.” Answer: B Rationale: When using the vaginal ring, the client should insert the ring and keep it in place for 3 weeks and then remove it on the same day of the week it was inserted. The ring can be expelled accidentally, such as with straining on defecation or removing a tampon. Typically, bleeding occurs once the ring is removed. The ring should be discarded after each use.

The nurse is scheduled to administer an oral contraceptive to a client admitted with type 2 diabetes. What is the priority teaching that would be provided regarding this medication? A) Take the medication the same time each day with food to decrease the development of nausea and vomiting. B) If you skip a dose, use another form of contraception until the first week of the next cycle of the oral contraceptive. C) Notify the primary care provider if your glucose is elevated because an adjustment in oral antidiabetic medications may be needed. D) Call the primary care provider for any sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, or redness, swelling, and pain in a leg. Answer: D Rationale: The priority for teaching in the situation is that the major adverse effect of taking oral contraceptives is the possibility for developing venous thromboembolism, a life-threatening emergency that must be reported to the primary care provider (PCP) right away. The nurse must teach the client on the signs and symptoms of a deep venous thrombosis: leg pain, redness, and edema. The client could also develop a pulmonary embolus with sudden dyspnea and chest pain. The other teaching points are not as high of a priority because they consist of how to take the medication to decrease the possible side effect of nausea, which usually decreases with taking the medication for a few months. Also, it is important to take the medication the same time of day to help remember to take it. Instructions about what to do if a dose is skipped is important to prevent pregnancy by instructing the client to use another form of contraception until the first week of the next cycle of the oral contraceptive. It is important for a client to report an elevated blood glucose level, so the PCP may consider what may be the cause for the increase and decide if an increase in the oral antidiabetic medications is necessary.

The nurse is scheduled to administer testosterone transdermal patch to a client admitted with primary hypogonadism. What is the priority teaching that would be provided regarding this medication? A) Apply nightly to clean, dry skin on the abdomen, thigh, back, or upper arm. B) Rotate sites with 7 days between applications to any given site. C) Remove old patch and fold in half and dispose of properly in trash can. D) Report to primary care provider any leg pain, redness, and swelling right away. Answer: D Rationale: The priority for teaching in the situation is that the major adverse effect of taking testosterone is the possibility for developing venous thromboembolism, so the nurse must teach the client on the signs and symptoms of a deep venous thrombosis: leg pain, redness, and edema. The client could also develop a pulmonary embolus with sudden dyspnea and chest pain. The other teaching points are not as high of a priority because they consist of Androderm application instructions, which are included on the package that the delivery systems are dispensed.

A nursing instructor is explaining the role of androgens to a nursing class. The instructor determines that the class was successful when the students correctly choose which action(s) of androgens after the onset of puberty? Select all that apply. A) Body fat distribution B) Muscle development C) Epiphyseal growth D) Glucose metabolism E) Body hair Answer: A, B, E Rationale: From puberty onward, androgens continue to aid in the development and maintenance of secondary sex characteristics, which include facial hair, deep voice, body hair, body fat distribution, and muscle development. Individuals with diabetes are at risk of developing hyperglycemia when androgens are also prescribed and the combination must be monitored carefully. The growth hormone will affect the epiphyseal growth and clients must be monitored to ensure the client does not suffer any adverse reactions associated with GH.

A nurse is teaching a client about the use of estradiol. The nurse warns the client of which dermatologic reaction(s) that may continue after drug discontinuation? Select all that apply. A) Dermatitis B) Stevens–Johnson syndrome C) Pruritus D) Chloasma E) Melasma Answer: D, E Rationale: Chloasma and melasma are dermatologic reactions that can result from the use of estrogens, like estradiol, and may continue when use of the drug is discontinued. Dermatitis and pruritus are potential adverse reactions that should clear up when the drug is discontinued. Stevens–Johnson syndrome can be seen when the client uses any of the following: cephalosporins, lamotrigine, sulfonamides, or allopurinol. The symptoms should clear up after the drug is discontinued and the syndrome is properly treated.

The nurse examines the history of a client prescribed oral contraceptive with estrogen and progestin and should report which as contraindication(s)? Select all that apply. A) Deep vein thrombosis B) Hypertension C) Estrogen-dependent breast cancer D) Fatty liver disease E) Migraine headaches Answer: A, C, D, E Rationale: The nurse should examine the history noting that hypertension is not a contraindication for taking an oral contraceptive. Thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism, is a contraindication because oral contraceptives increase risks for the formation of blood clots. Primary breast cancer whether it is estrogen dependent or not is a contraindication for taking an oral contraceptive. Any estrogen-dependent neoplasm, such as uterine or ovarian, is also a contraindication. Any liver disease or a reduction of the liver function is a contraindication for progestin because the hormone will not be properly metabolized. Migraine is a contraindication for progestin, one of the ingredients of the listed oral contraceptive.

The nurse is caring for a client in an outpatient clinic who plans to take an oral contraceptive. The nurse should perform which pre-administration assessment(s) before the client sees the primary care provider? Select all that apply. A) Determine menstrual history, including age of onset of menses, pattern of menses, and any changes to the pattern. B) Assess sexual history, including number of partners, sexual practices, and reason for wanting the contraceptive. C) Obtain an assessment of using tobacco products, smokeless tobacco, or any attempts to quit using tobacco. D) Gather client history of any breast, uterine, or ovarian cancers, cardiovascular, or thromboembolism disorders. E) Collect accurate blood pressure in both arms for comparison and orthostatic blood pressure readings supine and standing. Answer: A, B, C, D Rationale: The nurse should assess the client's complete menstrual history to determine if the menses are regular or irregular, and if there are any problems with menstruation. Sexual history is important to gain information as to the client's risk-taking behaviors, and understanding that oral contraceptives do not decrease the risks for sexually transmitted infections. It is important to determine the reasons why the client wants oral contraception. It is important to assess use of tobacco products, including smokeless products that contain nicotine, because they increase risks for developing blood clots and thromboembolism. A thorough history should be taken to determine if contraindications exists for taking an oral contraceptive. This includes primary breast cancer, estrogen neoplasms of the uterus or ovaries, cardiovascular diseases, such as heart valve disease, or stroke. Other contraindications include thromboembolism related disorders, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The nurse should take vital signs and record them, but does not need to assess blood pressure in both arms and take an orthostatic blood pressure because the oral contraceptives does not cause postural hypotension.
