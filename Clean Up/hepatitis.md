Hepatitis is an inflammation of the [[Liver]], a vital organ responsible for many functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The inflammation can be caused by various factors, including viral infections, [[Alcohol]] abuse, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune diseases.

### Types of Hepatitis:
1. **Viral Hepatitis:**
   - **Hepatitis A (HAV):** Typically spread through contaminated food or water, Hepatitis A is usually a short-term infection and does not lead to chronic [[Liver]] disease.
   - **Hepatitis B (HBV):** Spread through contact with infected [[Blood]], semen, or other body fluids. Hepatitis B can be both acute and chronic, potentially leading to serious [[Liver]] damage, including cirrhosis and [[Liver]] cancer.
   - **Hepatitis C (HCV):** Primarily spread through [[Blood]]-to-[[Blood]] contact, often through sharing needles or other equipment to inject [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]. Hepatitis C can lead to chronic infection, which may cause long-term [[Liver]] damage.
   - **Hepatitis D (HDV):** A rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in people who are already infected with Hepatitis B. It can make the HBV infection more severe.
   - **Hepatitis E (HEV):** Similar to Hepatitis A, this virus is typically spread through contaminated food or water and is more common in developing countries.

2. **Alcoholic Hepatitis:** Caused by excessive [[Alcohol]] consumption over time, leading to [[Liver]] inflammation and damage.

3. **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** An autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the [[Liver]], leading to inflammation.

4. **Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH):** A form of nonalcoholic fatty [[Liver]] disease (NAFLD) where fat accumulation in the [[Liver]] leads to inflammation and damage, not related to [[Alcohol]] use.

### Symptoms:
- **Jaundice:** Yellowing of the skin and eyes
- **Fatigue**
- **Abdominal pain or discomfort, particularly in the upper right side**
- **Dark urine**
- **Pale stool**
- **Nausea and vomiting**
- **Loss of appetite**
- **Joint pain (particularly in cases of viral hepatitis)**

### Diagnosis and Treatment:
Diagnosis typically involves [[Blood]] tests to detect the presence of hepatitis viruses, [[Liver]] function tests, imaging studies like [[ultrasound]], and sometimes a [[Liver]] biopsy.

Treatment depends on the type and cause of hepatitis:
- **Viral hepatitis:** Antiviral medications, rest, and supportive care.
- **Alcoholic hepatitis:** Cessation of [[Alcohol]] use, medications to reduce inflammation, and sometimes nutritional support.
- **Autoimmune hepatitis:** Immunosuppressive medications like [[Corticosteroids]].
- **NASH:** Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, diet, and exercise.

Preventative measures include vaccination (available for Hepatitis A and B), practicing good hygiene, avoiding risky behaviors (like sharing needles), and limiting [[Alcohol]] consumption.
