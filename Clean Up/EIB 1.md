In medical terminology, **EIB** typically stands for **Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction**. It refers to the narrowing of the airways that occurs as a response to exercise, leading to symptoms such as:

- Shortness of breath
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Coughing (often after exercising)

**EIB** is commonly associated with asthma but can also occur in people without chronic asthma. It is usually triggered by activities that involve prolonged breathing of cold or dry air.
