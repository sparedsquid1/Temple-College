Will be followed by Cardiology for approx. a year ▪ Prognosis: Excellent 5 6 2/25/2025 4 Ventricular Septal Defect (Increase Pulmonary Blood Flow) **Most common heart anomaly in children** **Can be mild to severe** Signs: loud, harsh systolic murmur, failure to thrive, poor feeder, fatigues easily Treatment: May close spontaneously • Mild– observation, monitor, antibiotic with dental care • Severe– Surgery to patch hole Prognosis: Excellent (after surgery) 7 8 2/25/2025 5 Patent Ductus Arteriosus (Increase Pulmonary Blood Flow) **Oxygenated blood recycles to lungs causing pulmonary circulatory congestion** Signs: None (early), dyspnea (later), radial pulse full and bounding, wide pulse pressure, machinery-type murmur Treatment: Indocin (preemies), Surgery to ligate (full-term newborns) Prognosis: Excellent 9 10 2/25/2025 6 Coarctation of the Aorta (Obstructive Defect) **Narrowing of the aortic arch OR the descending aorta** Signs: None (early), marked difference in B/P and pulses of upper extremities and lower extremities, systolic murmur. Treatment: Surgery – remove narrowed area and reconnect ends (between ages 2 and 4) or percutaneous balloon angioplasty for older children Prognosis: Good (after surgery) If untreated, can lead to HTN, CHF 11 12 2/25/2025 7 Tetralogy of Fallot (Decrease Pulmonary Blood Flow) **Four defects** 1. Stenosis of the pulmonary artery 2. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle 3. Overriding aorta 4. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) 13 14 2/25/2025 8 Tetralogy of Fallot Signs: Cyanosis, clubbing of fingers due to chronic hypoxia, feeding problems, growth retardation, polycythemia, “tet” spells (increase the return of venous blood back to the heart), chronic respiratory infections, “boot-shaped” heart on X-ray Treatment: Surgery to correct defects ▪ Must take antibiotics prophylactically before procedures Prognosis: Good (after surgery) 15 16 2/25/2025 9 cxrtofap 17 18 2/25/2025 10 Hypoplastic Left Heart ▪ **Underdevelopment of left side of heart** ▪ If baby does have PDA and patent foramen ovale, chances of survival is small. ▪ Symptoms: Grayish-blue skin, dyspnea, weak pulses, murmur ▪ Treatment: possible ventilator, prostaglandin E1 to keep DA open, and heart transplant ▪ Transplant is needed within 1 month of age ▪ Prognosis: Fatal if left untreated 19 20 2/25/2025 11 Parenting Concerns • Return to normalcy as soon as possible • Do not over indulge • Hold immunizations, if heart transplant • Dental care 21 22 2/25/2025 12 Acquired Heart Disease • Occurs after birth • May be a complication of a congenital heart disease or a response to respiratory infection, sepsis, hypertension, or severe anemia • Heart failure is a decrease in cardiac output necessary to meet the metabolic needs of the body Congestive Heart Failure (Acquired Heart Disease) **May be caused by respiratory infections, sepsis, HTN, severe anemia** Signs: Cyanosis, pallor, tachypnea, tachycardia, feeding difficulties, FTT, edema, respiratory infections Treatment: Oxygen, Lanoxin, Diuretics, organize care to provide rest, small & frequent feedings Nursing Care: Strict I/O’s, recognize dig. toxicity, s/s dehydration, teaching of family Digoxin: In infants and children, if the pulse rate is below 100 hold the medication and notify MD 23 24 2/25/2025 13 Rheumatic Fever (Acquired Heart Disease) Reaction to a group A beta-hemolytic infection of the throat **Systemic collagen disease affecting joints, heart, CNS, skin, subcutaneous tissues** Signs: migratory polyarthritis, skin eruptions, Sydenham’s Chorea, Rheumatic carditis (often mitral valve), abdominal pain, fever, pallor, fatigue Erythema marginatum Mitral valve stenosis (narrowing) 25 26 2/25/2025 14 Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis: Jones criteria (2 major or 1 major and 2 minor), Chest X-Ray, throat culture Treatment: Penicillin or EES x 10 days, then Penicillin monthly for 5 years, aspirin, rest, small frequent feedings Prognosis: Depending on diagnosis and treatment Systemic Hypertension (Acquired Heart Disease) **Being seen more in childhood and adolescence** Primary – unknown Secondary – related to other diseases Signs: (None), headaches, vision problems, dizziness (recognized on physical exam) Treatment: Nutrition counseling, low sodium diet, lose weight, aerobic exercise program, discuss risk factors 27 28 2/25/2025 15 Hyperlipidemia ▪ The good vs the bad cholesterol ▪ LDL ▪ HDL ▪ Family history ▪ Health promotion – Page 635 Kawasaki Disease (Acquired Heart Disease) **Mucocutaneous Lymph node Syndrome** Signs: Abrupt onset of high fever that – with no response to antipyretics, “strawberry tongue”, enlarged non-tender lymph nodes, rash, swollen hands, peeling of palms/soles. Treatment: IV gamma globulin given early in illness, aspirin, Coumadin Prognosis: Good if treated and followed up.
