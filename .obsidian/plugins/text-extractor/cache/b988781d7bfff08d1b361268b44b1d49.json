Worked with a wide range of residents in varying stages of health and ages. I was able to provide comfort to several family members of a resident shortly before her death. By not being intimated or dismayed by 1st impressions or comments from staff and spending quality time with Pt I was able to earn their trust and then determine specific needs of patients and then plan for and meet those needs.
