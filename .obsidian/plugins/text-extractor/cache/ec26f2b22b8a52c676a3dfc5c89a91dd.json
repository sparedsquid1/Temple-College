resistance—some bacteria develop the ability to produce substances that inactivate or destroy the antibiotic  Drug resistance becomes an issue when: o Antibiotics are regularly used by a client o A group of people live in close proximity  Bacteria are either naturally resistant or develop acquired resistance to drug, such as MRSA  Emergence of a new resistance associated with bacteria that have both a natural and an acquired resistance ability Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antibiotic Stewardship Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved

What signs or symptoms should the nurse tell the mother to look for that may indicate an allergic reaction has occurred? 2. What should the nurse tell the child’s mother about oral suspensions? 3. What should the nurse tell the child’s mother about the prevention of anti- infective resistance?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
