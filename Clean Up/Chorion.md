The **chorion** is one of the key membranes that support the developing embryo and fetus during pregnancy. It forms the outermost fetal membrane and plays an essential role in protecting the fetus and facilitating nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus.

### **Key Functions and Characteristics of the Chorion**:

1. **Protective Membrane**:
   - The chorion surrounds the embryo and other fetal membranes (like the amnion) and forms a protective barrier between the developing fetus and the outside environment.

2. **[[placenta]] Formation**:
   - The chorion is crucial in the development of the **[[placenta]]**. The outer layer of the chorion (called the **chorionic [[Villi]]**) extends into the uterine wall and helps form the [[placenta]], which is the site where nutrients and oxygen are exchanged between the mother and the fetus.
   - These chorionic [[Villi]] increase the surface area for exchange and anchor the fetus to the uterine wall.

3. **Gas and Nutrient Exchange**:
   - Through the [[placenta]], the chorion helps facilitate the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and waste products between the mother and fetus.

4. **Secretion of [[Hormones]]**:
   - The chorion produces important [[Hormones]] like **[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] ([[Human chorionic gonadotropin]])**, which supports the pregnancy by maintaining the corpus luteum and promoting the production of [[progesterone]] during early pregnancy.

5. **Development**:
   - The chorion develops from the **trophoblast** cells that surround the embryo after [[implantation]]. As the pregnancy progresses, the chorion becomes closely associated with the amnion (the inner membrane) and contributes to the [[amniotic sac]] that holds the amniotic fluid.

6. **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**:
   - In prenatal testing, **chorionic villus sampling** (CVS) involves taking a small sample of tissue from the chorionic [[Villi]] to check for genetic abnormalities in the fetus.

The chorion plays a vital role in supporting the embryo and fetus throughout pregnancy, especially in forming the [[placenta]] and ensuring the exchange of vital substances between the mother and fetus.
