### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions to immune globulins are rare. However, local tenderness and pain at the injection site may occur. The most common adverse reactions include [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], erythema, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, headache, chills, and [[Fever]]. Adverse reactions, if they occur, may last for several hours. Systemic reactions are extremely rare, with the exception of immune globulins given to prevent posttransplant rejection. These immune globulins are made from equine (horse) or rabbit serum and can produce anaphylactic reactions. They should be administered only under the direction of a physician specializing in transplantation medicine. 

The antivenins may cause various reactions, with hypersensitivity being the most severe. Some antivenins are prepared from equine serum, and if a client is sensitive to equine serum, serious reactions or death may result. The immediate reactions usually occur within 30Â min after administration of the antivenin. Symptoms include apprehension; flushing; itching; [[urticaria]]; edema of the face, [[Tongue]], and throat; cough; dyspnea; vomiting; cyanosis; and collapse. Other adverse reactions are included in the Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents.

### Contraindications
Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are used with extreme caution in individuals with a history of allergies. Sensitivity testing may be performed in individuals with a history of allergies. Because of the potential harm to a fetus, no adequate studies have been conducted in pregnant women, and it is also not known whether these agents are excreted in breast milk. Thus the immunologic agents ([[Preg Cat C]]) are used with caution in pregnant women and during lactation. 

The immune globulins are contraindicated in clients with a history of allergic reactions after administration of human immunoglobulin preparations and in individuals with isolated immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (individuals could have an anaphylactic reaction to subsequent administration of [[Blood]] products that contain IgA).
