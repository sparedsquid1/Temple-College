Data collection is inﬂuenced by the observers’ presence (if recognized) and whether the observer documents all misses and completions appropriately. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the average rate of health care worker compliance with hand hygiene guidelines ranges from 40% to 60%. 1 Many facilities report perfect performance, however. 1 These discrep- ancies indicate that it is important to examine basic hand hy- giene facts to understand the variability in hand hygiene compliance rates and the effects of hand hygiene failures. As many as 2% to 5% of all surgical procedures will result in a surgical site infection (SSI). 2 Surgical site infections are the most common and costly health careeassociated infections, with approximately 60% of SSIs deemed preventable using evidence-based guidelines.2 Hand hygiene and surgical hand antisepsis are effective, efﬁcient methods to prevent infections in the perioperative setting, 3 and a failure to perform proper hand hygiene provides an opportunity for potential infection transmission. Hand hygiene failure includes more than omis- sion and can include \u0001 using the wrong product, \u0001 applying the product improperly, or \u0001 performing abbreviated hand hygiene. Any of these omissions will result in microorganisms being left on the hands to be passed on to the next patient or surface that is touched. Proving that a lack of proper hand hygiene is the cause of an infection is difﬁcult, however, although many http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aorn.2017.04.011 ª AORN, Inc, 2017 614 jAORN Journal www.aornjournal.org PATIENT SAFETY FIRST outbreaks have been linked to poor hand hygiene practices.4 Outbreaks of infections have been associated with the lack of effective hand hygiene during periods of understafﬁng, the presence of residual gram-negative bacteria on staff members’ hands, and central lineeassociated bloodstream infections.4 Focusing on the basics of hand hygiene can improve compliance and patient outcomes. Basic problem solving for process improvement may begin with asking questions about how an action is performed (ie, who, what, when, where, why, how). Applying these simple questions to hand hygiene practices helps to reinforce the importance of hand hygiene and assists with solidifying surgical staff member compliance. CONSEQUENCES OF HAND HYGIENE FAILURES Failure to perform hand hygiene affects patients and facility staff members. According to the World Health Organization, failure to perform hand hygiene can result in the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 1,5 Surgical site infections may be linked to contamination with endogenous or exogenous skin ﬂora. 4 Contamination can originate from ﬂora on the patient’s skin as a result of poor surgical skin preparation, or it may result from cross-contamination of the incision. Wearing improper surgical attire or performing a poor surgical hand scrub or poor routine hand hygiene can result in the con- tamination of an incision with staff members’ ﬂora. Leaders and infection preventionists should validate the performance of a soap and water surgical hand scrub or an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) by direct observation on a regular basis to ensure that staff members understand the procedure and comply fully. Improper surgical hand scrub technique or failure to perform hand hygiene are commonly cited as infection control lapses when infection preventionists perform direct observations of surgical procedures. When care providers practice improper hand hygiene, pa- tients may experience nonhealing surgical wounds, a loss of implants,orevenlossoflife.1 Afterapatientisdiagnosed with an SSI, he or she spends approximately 7 to 11 addi- tional days in the hospital and is placed at a 2- to 11-times higher risk of death than patients without SSIs.3 Staff members can also be affected, because hand hygiene failure may increase the transmission of bloodborne pathogens and common respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.5 Improper hand hygiene has also resulted in staff members developing skin conditions, including dermatitis and ony- chomycosis, on the hands.4 PERFORMING HAND HYGIENE TO PREVENT INFECTION Hand hygiene has been well established as the single most effective and least expensive method for preventing in- fections, including SSIs.3,5 Randomized controlled trials cite many instances of an indirect connection between poor hand hygiene and SSIs and multidrug-resistant organism in- fections.1,2 Hand hygiene is a basic practice that all health care workers should adhere to, but it is often omitted or performed incorrectly.5 Health care leaders commit millions of dollars to provide the best medical equipment and tech- nology to prevent SSIs and other health careeassociated in- fections,2 and staff members’ commitment to proper hand hygiene practices has been shown to reduce adverse patient outcomes.1 By slowing down and focusing on the basics of hand hygiene, staff members can have a substantial effect on reducing the number of SSIs and multidrug-resistant organism infections. In the perioperative setting, hand hygiene includes both the surgical hand scrub and routine hand hygiene. The surgical hand scrub is essential to a successful surgery, and attention to detail is key to proper performance. To ensure hands are free of transient microorganisms and to signiﬁcantly reduce resi- dent bacteria, staff members should \u0001 remove jewelry, \u0001 don a face mask before beginning the surgical hand scrub, \u0001 select an appropriate scrub solution, \u0001 perform a correctly timed and sequenced surgical hand scrub, and \u0001 follow the antiseptic solution manufacturer’s recommenda- tions for use. 1,3,5 Perioperative staff members may often verbalize each step of a surgical hand scrub, but room turnovers, casual conversations, and other distractions may account for lapses in performing this important sequence of events.4 Surgical scrubs protect the patient during the actual procedure, but attention to detail is also required for routine hand hy- giene.1 To perform a proper hand wash, staff members should \u0001 remove jewelry; \u0001 wet hands with warm (not hot) water; \u0001 apply the appropriate amount of soap, following manufac- turer’s recommendation for use; \u0001 lather hands by rubbing together, focusing on all surfaces including the backs of the hands, nails, thumbs, and webs; \u0001 scrub for at least 20 seconds; \u0001 rinse hands thoroughly under warm water; June 2017, Vol. 105, No. 6 Surgical Hand Hygiene Compliance www.aornjournal.org AORN Journal j615 \u0001 dry hands thoroughly using a clean single-use towel; and \u0001 use a towel to turn off faucet. 1 If using an ABHR, staff members should place the recom- mended amount of product in the palm, rubs hands together covering all surfaces including backs of hands, nails, thumbs, and webs until the hands feel dry. This process should take approximately 20 seconds. 1 When performed correctly, hand hygiene allows health care workers to prevent the transmission of microorganisms to their patients and reduce the potential for health careeassociated infections. When to Perform Hand Hygiene Routine hand hygiene should be performed by all staff members, not just scrubbed team members. Hand hygiene is required before and after every patient contact, as well as after contact with equipment, charts, electrical cords, and keyboards. Staff members should pause to perform hand hygiene every time they move from a dirty to clean activity or before performing an aseptic procedure (eg, urinary catheter insertion).1 Perioperative hand hygiene should be performed \u0001 before entering the OR suite, \u0001 before touching the patient or environment, \u0001 immediately before an aseptic task, \u0001 immediately after exposure to blood or body ﬂuids, \u0001 after touching the patient, and \u0001 after touching equipment or leaving the OR suite. 5 In addition to these instances, anesthesia professionals will perform other tasks before and after which hand hygiene is warranted (eg, medication preparation, intubation). Sterileglovesprovideafalse senseof protectionfor staff members, who may believe that wearing gloves renders cleaning of the hands unnecessary; however, personnel should perform hand hygiene every time they remove a pair of gloves. 1,5 The moisture created from wearing gloves provides an ideal envi- ronment for bacterial growth, and research has shown that gloves fail as an effective barrier as much as 30% of the time. 1 Critical Hand Hygiene Components Hand hygiene begins with healthy hands, which can prevent the transmission of microorganisms. Skin cracks or rashes inhibit the ability to properly clean the hands.2 The applica- tion of hand lotion is key to maintaining intact skin in light of the multiple hand hygiene requirements of the surgical team; the surgical hand scrub is also more harsh on skin integrity than routine hand washing with soap and water. 1,4,5 Both medicated soaps and ABHRs cause hands to lose moisture. Alcohol-based hand rubs do contain emollients but not enough to prevent excessive drying as a result of the alcohol content. Personnel should use health careeapproved lotions, not commercial lotions, while at work. Commercial lotions are usually oil-based and can interact with glove material, causing microscopic holes in the gloves or contact dermatitis on the hands. Chemical reactions between the scrub solution and commercial lotions can also render the scrub solution inef- fective. Health careeapproved lotions are either water- or silicone-based to avoid these interactions.6 Fingernails have been identiﬁed as a mechanism for the transmission of infections. 3 To reduce this risk, personnel should keep their ﬁngernails less than 2 mm (0.08 inch) in length and well-groomed to allow thorough cleaning under and around the nails.3 Unkempt or long nails are prone to tearing gloves, which eliminates the protective barrier against bloodborne pathogens. 3 If nail polish is allowed, it should be free of chips, to avoid harboring microorganisms. Artiﬁcial nails should not be worn in surgical services. The gaps around the artiﬁcial nails may harbor bacteria, posing a risk to both the patient and the wearer. 1,3-5 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, AORN, and the World Health Organization have provided detailed guidelines for hand hygiene as well as many tools to assist with improving performance.1,3,5 The Joint Commission also pro- vides a free tool kit addressing hand hygiene to support compliance with the National Patient Safety Goal related to SSI prevention. 7 ACCESSIBILITY OF HAND HYGIENE PRODUCTS Compliance with hand hygiene guidelines depends on the available products and dispensing stations located in areas where hand hygiene tasks are most often performed. 1,5 Several studies have shown that ABHRs are as effective as medicated soap and water unless hands are visibly soiled. 1,4,5 A scrub sink should be conveniently located next to all surgical suites, and it should also serve as a basic hand wash sink. In addition to the sinks, waterless hand hygiene stations should be readily available at the entrance to the suite and in the anesthesia professional’s and RN circulator’s work areas. Safety codes regulate the location of ABHRs because of the ﬁre risk associated with their high concentration of alcohol. A multidisciplinary team of end users, a safety ofﬁcer, an infection preventionist, and representatives from facility ser- vices should determine how many dispensers are required and where they should be located. 3,8 Additional hand hygiene Padgette June 2017, Vol. 105, No. 6 616 jAORN Journal www.aornjournal.org stations beyond the surgical suite provide easy access while staff members are performing tasks in common areas. Assuring ABHRs are readily available is key to compliance. GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE Staff members can have the proper training, equipment, and products and still fail to correctly comply with hand hygiene performance standards. 1,4,5 Compliance failures occur for multiple reasons. One hundred percent compliance with hand hygiene is difﬁcult to obtain on a daily basis. The Joint Commission states that when asked why hand hygiene was not performed, staff members cite being too busy or forgetting; the lack of available hand hygiene products is another frequent reason cited for failure to perform hand hygiene.8 Forgetting may include omitting the entire process or missing steps in the process, and either oversight can lead to the potential spread of microorganisms. Although these reasons may sound plausible, being too busy or forgetting essential steps in a process is not safe patient care and is unacceptable. Misperceptions of Hand Hygiene Staff members may not perform hand hygiene as often as needed because of the perception that the alcohol in ABHRs dries their hands and creates cracks in the skin. Alcohol-based hand rubs are actually healthier for skin than medicated soap is.1,5,8 Medicated soaps are derived from harsh chemicals that can lead to drying or reaction to the chemicals. Alcohol-based hand rubs contain emollients to help prevent excessive drying of the skin. Skin irritations also may develop from incomplete drying of the hands after scrubbing with soap and water, or from the use of com- mercial lotion before donning gloves resulting in a chemical dermatitis. Without the use of ABHRs when performing patient care, it would be nearly impossible to perform proper hand hygiene according to guidelines. A hand wash with soap and water requires approximately 40 to 60 seconds to complete. 5 If all opportunities for hand hygiene were completed with soap and water alone, there would be little time remaining to complete other tasks. An ABHR can usually be accomplished in approximately 20 to 30 seconds, allowing more time for other tasks.5 Additionally, staff members can perform tasks such as talking to a patient, walking to the next task, or reviewing a document while using an ABHR. Another misperception is that gloves prevent the hands from becoming soiled; however, gloves are not a 100% effective protective barrier, and microorganisms can proliferate inside the gloves while they are worn. In a recent survey of surgical team members, 15% responded that hand hygiene was usually or always performed before donning or after removing gloves.9 Hand hygiene is required, even if another pair of gloves is going to be donned.1 Personnel should evaluate missed op- portunities for hand hygiene and review and correct any process that is not working well.1,2,4,5,8 Strategies to Improve Compliance Hand hygiene is a learned task, just as the other tasks that are performed in the surgical arena. Perioperative personnel are excellent at anticipating next steps,7 and the ﬁrst step toward improving hand hygiene is for each perioperative staff member to commit to guideline adherence. Also, leaders must commit to providing the support systems that allow adherence to and enforcement of those guidelines.2 Surgical teams demonstrate good teamwork when they coordinate their efforts toward a common goal. This teamwork should expand to include team members reminding one another to perform hand hygiene. Efforts to improve hand hygiene performance must be mon- itored to ensure continued compliance. 3 Perioperative leaders should post compliance data to scorecards or performance improvement boards in the same manner as other quality metrics (eg, turnover times, time outs, SSI rates).3,4 Multiple tools exist to improve hand hygiene compliance and are readily accessible from numerous agencies (eg, The Joint Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, and AORN). Hand hygiene observation tools come in many for- mats including paper audit forms and smartphone apps. Teams should implement these tools in their hand hygiene performance improvement initiatives. Hand hygiene compli- ance can be improved, but it takes a team commitment to ensure infection prevention measures are enforced with every patient, every time. CONCLUSION Hand hygiene is essential to a safe culture that leads to improved patient outcomes and protection for staff members. Commitment to reviewing the basics of hand hygiene, iden- tifying infection prevention lapses, and adhering to industry guidelines will help prevent SSIs, reduce health care costs, and improve patient safety. \u0001 Acknowledgment: The author thanks Brittain Wood, BSN, RN, CIC, infection preventionist for Duke Infection Control Outreach Network, Durham, NC, for editorial assistance.
