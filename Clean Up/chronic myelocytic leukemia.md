Chronic myelocytic [[Leukemia]] (CML), also known as chronic myeloid [[Leukemia]], is a type of cancer that originates in the bone marrow, where [[Blood]] cells are produced. It primarily affects the myeloid cells, which are the precursors to red [[Blood]] cells, platelets, and some types of white [[Blood]] cells. CML is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of these cells, leading to an accumulation of immature white [[Blood]] cells in the [[Blood]] and bone marrow.

### Key Features of Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia:
- **Philadelphia [[chromosome]]:** CML is most commonly associated with a genetic abnormality known as the Philadelphia [[chromosome]], which results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation creates an abnormal [[gene]], BCR-ABL, that produces a protein with tyrosine kinase activity, leading to uncontrolled cell division.
- **Phases of CML:** 
  - **Chronic Phase:** Most patients are diagnosed in this phase, where the disease progresses slowly, and symptoms may be mild or absent.
  - **Accelerated Phase:** The disease progresses more rapidly, with increasing symptoms and more abnormal cells in the [[Blood]] and bone marrow.
  - **Blast Crisis:** This is the most advanced phase, resembling acute [[Leukemia]], with a high number of immature white [[Blood]] cells (blasts). It is often more difficult to treat and has a poorer prognosis.

### Symptoms:
- **Fatigue:** Due to anemia or the disease itself.
- **Weight Loss:** Unintentional weight loss can occur as the disease progresses.
- **Night Sweats:** Common in many types of [[Leukemia]].
- **Splenomegaly:** Enlargement of the spleen, which may cause discomfort or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen.
- **Bruising and Bleeding:** Due to low platelet counts.
- **Frequent Infections:** Resulting from a high number of abnormal white [[Blood]] cells that donâ€™t function properly.

### Diagnosis:
- **Complete [[Blood]] Count (CBC):** A CBC often reveals an elevated white [[Blood]] cell count with an increased number of immature myeloid cells.
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** This test confirms the diagnosis by examining the bone marrow and identifying the presence of the Philadelphia [[chromosome]].
- **[[genetic testing]]:** Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can detect the BCR-ABL [[gene]].

### Treatment:
- **Tyrosine [[Kinase Inhibitors]] ([[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]]):** These are the frontline treatment for CML. [[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]], such as [[imatinib]] (Gleevec), [[dasatinib]], and [[nilotinib]], target the BCR-ABL protein and have dramatically improved the prognosis of CML.
- **Stem Cell Transplant:** In cases where [[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]] are ineffective, a stem cell (or bone marrow) transplant may be considered, particularly for younger patients or those in advanced stages.
- **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of the BCR-ABL [[gene]] levels in the [[Blood]] is essential to assess treatment response and detect any signs of resistance or disease progression.

### Prognosis:
With the advent of [[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]], the prognosis for patients with CML has improved significantly. Many patients achieve long-term remission and live normal or near-normal lifespans. However, the disease can still progress, particularly if resistance to [[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]] develops, making ongoing monitoring and treatment adjustment crucial.

### Living with CML:
CML is often managed as a chronic condition, requiring long-term treatment and follow-up. Patients generally need to take [[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]] for life to keep the disease under control, though side effects and the risk of resistance need to be managed with their healthcare team. Regular follow-ups with a hematologist or oncologist are essential for optimal management.
