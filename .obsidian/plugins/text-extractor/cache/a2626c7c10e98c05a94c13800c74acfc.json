Once you have completed your PIH simulation you will then need to complete post-simulation assignments. Your post-simulation assignments are: • ATI charting (nurse)/Self-reflection (relative/observer) • PIH Quiz (everyone) All pre-simulation work is to be completed by every student. You will only need to complete these assignments once for each simulation. For example: You are the nurse for the postpartum simulation, you complete all pre-simulation work (postpartum medication worksheet and BUBBLEHEHE). The next time you come to simulation, you are the relative for the postpartum simulation but have already completed the postpartum medication worksheet and BUBBLEHEHE, you do not have to complete them again because you have already submitted them when you were the nurse. You may be required to give medication within your simulation so application of dosage calculations will be expected of each student. Please come prepared for each simulation with your ATI username and password, paper, pen, stethoscope, pen light, and dressed in full uniform. Simulation Absence or Tardiness You must contact me by 0600 via TEAMS if you are going to be late or absent. If you are late to your simulation, this may jeopardize your opportunity to complete the simulation. If you are absent on your scheduled OB simulation day, you are still responsible for turning in your pre- simulation assignments, post-simulation quiz, and assigned alternate assignment. 5 points will be deducted each day they are late including the day they are due and weekends. Simulations cannot be made up.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
