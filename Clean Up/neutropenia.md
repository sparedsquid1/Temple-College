Neutropenia is a condition characterized by an abnormally low count of [[Neutrophils]], a type of white [[Blood]] cell essential in fighting infections. [[Neutrophils]] are a vital component of the immune system, so when their levels are low, the body becomes more susceptible to infections.

### Causes of Neutropenia
Neutropenia can result from various causes, including:
1. **Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy**: Common in cancer treatments, these therapies can damage bone marrow, reducing neutrophil production.
2. **Autoimmune Diseases**: Disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can lead to the destruction of [[Neutrophils]].
3. **Bone Marrow Disorders**: Conditions like [[Leukemia]] and [[aplastic anemia]] impair neutrophil production.
4. **Infections**: Certain viral infections, such as HIV or [[hepatitis]], can lower neutrophil levels.
5. **Medications**: Some [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], like antibiotics, [[Antipsychotics]], and [[Anticonvulsants]], can lead to neutropenia as a side effect.
6. **Genetic Conditions**: Certain congenital disorders, such as Kostmann syndrome or cyclic neutropenia, result in chronic or cyclical low neutrophil levels.

### Symptoms
While neutropenia itself doesn’t cause symptoms, it increases the risk of infections. Patients with neutropenia may experience:
- Frequent fevers
- [[Mouth]] sores or ulcers
- Skin abscesses
- Chronic sinus infections
- [[Respiratory]] infections (e.g., pneumonia)

### Diagnosis
A complete [[Blood]] count (CBC) with differential is typically used to diagnose neutropenia. Based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), the severity of neutropenia can be classified as:
- **Mild**: ANC 1000–1500 cells/µL
- **Moderate**: ANC 500–1000 cells/µL
- **Severe**: ANC <500 cells/µL

### Management and Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity. General approaches may include:
1. **Antibiotics and Antifungal Medications**: To treat or prevent infections.
2. **Growth Factor Therapy**: Medications like granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-[[CSF]]) help stimulate neutrophil production.
3. **Treatment of Underlying Cause**: Managing the primary condition, such as cancer or autoimmune disease, may improve neutropenia.
4. **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Avoiding crowds, maintaining good hygiene, and practicing food safety to reduce infection risk.

Individuals with severe or chronic neutropenia may need specialized care from hematologists and infectious disease specialists to manage their condition effectively.
