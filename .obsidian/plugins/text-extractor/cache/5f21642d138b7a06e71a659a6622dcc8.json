The article’s authors were: Semyon Melnikov, PhD, RN Alex Furmanov, MSc, RN Alik Gololobov, MA, RN Muhammad Atrash, MA, RN Chaya Broyer, MA, RN Marta Gelkop, MA, RN Slava Gezunterman, MA, RN Tova David, MA, RN Esam Kadry, MA, RN Ruti Nave, MA, RN Edna Shalom, MA, RN Noga Shoval, MA, RN Gregory Traytel, MA, RN Nagah Zaid, MA, RN Shoshy Goldberg, PhD, RN Amir Vardi, MD and Limor Eisenberg, MA, RN. The article was published in the peer-reviewed journal of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses in the June 2021 release. It is important to read and review and use evidence-based article when making nursing decisions in clinical practice because it’s important to have clearly defined roles in the care of patients supported by ECMO. The article I reviewed explained that there had not been any clear policies on defining authority and responsibility of nursing staff in the treatment of ECMO supported patients. The authors also explained that there is a need for division of responsibilities between RN’s and Perfusionists. The authors also shared there is a need for dedicated ECMO training. The article taught me the importance of interdisciplinary experts working together to define clear discernable roles and responsibilities with specialized care, such as ECMO. I believe the article’s focus on formulating evidence-based recommendations for nursing care of ECMO-supported patients can be applied in the clinical setting. For example, in the clinical setting, a nurse can apply the information by identifying areas where there are opportunities to put rigor and structure around care of patients and create committees consisting of representatives from all areas of care around that need. Another application example gained from the article is to applied it when standards of care are defined, implemented, and incorporated in the clinical setting.
