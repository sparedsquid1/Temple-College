Contraindications and Precautions Epoetin alfa is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension, those needing an emergency transfusion, and those with a hypersensitivity to human albumin. [[darbepoetin alfa]] (Aranesp) is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension or in those allergic to the drug.
