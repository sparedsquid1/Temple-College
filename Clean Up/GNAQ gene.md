The GNAQ gene (guanine nucleotide-binding protein Q subunit alpha) is ==located on chromosome 9==. It encodes a protein called Gαq, which is involved in cell signaling pathways. 

Functions: 

- Regulates blood vessel development and function
- Plays a role in cell growth and differentiation
- Mediates responses to hormones and other extracellular signals 

Mutations: 

Mutations in the GNAQ gene can lead to several disorders, including: 

- **Sturge-Weber syndrome:** A condition characterized by port-wine birthmarks, seizures, and glaucoma.

- **Melanoma:** A type of skin cancer.

- **Capillary malformations:** Benign growths of blood vessels. 

Inheritance:

GNAQ mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a person only needs to inherit one mutated copy of the gene from either parent to develop a disorder.
