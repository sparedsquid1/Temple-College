"Mets" in the context of cancer typically refers to **metastases**, which are the spread of cancer cells from the primary site (where the cancer started) to other parts of the body. This process is a hallmark of advanced cancer and can significantly impact treatment and prognosis.

### Key Points About Metastases (Mets):

1. **Process of Metastasis**:
   - **Invasion**: Cancer cells invade nearby normal tissue.
   - **Circulation**: They enter the bloodstream or [[Lymphatic system]], which can carry them to other parts of the body.
   - **Growth**: Once the cancer cells arrive at a new site, they begin to grow and form new tumors, known as metastatic tumors or "mets."

2. **Common Sites**:
   - Different cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs. For example:
     - **Breast cancer** often spreads to the bones, lungs, [[Liver]], or brain.
     - **Prostate cancer** commonly metastasizes to the bones.
     - **Lung cancer** may spread to the brain, bones, [[Liver]], or adrenal glands.
     - **Colorectal cancer** often spreads to the [[Liver]] or lungs.

3. **Symptoms**:
   - The symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the metastases are located. For instance:
     - **[[bone metastases]]** can cause pain and fractures.
     - **Brain metastases** might lead to headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits.
     - **[[Liver]] metastases** can cause jaundice, pain in the upper abdomen, and fatigue.
     - **Lung metastases** may result in shortness of breath or chest pain.

4. **Diagnosis**:
   - Metastases are typically diagnosed through imaging studies like CT scans, MRIs, PET scans, or bone scans. Sometimes, a biopsy is needed to confirm that a tumor is a metastasis rather than a new primary cancer.

5. **Treatment**:
   - Treatment for metastatic cancer is often more complex and may involve systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or hormone therapy. In some cases, radiation therapy or surgery might be used to control symptoms or reduce tumor burden.
   - The goal of treatment might shift from curative to palliative, focusing on controlling the disease and improving quality of life.

6. **Prognosis**:
   - The prognosis for metastatic cancer depends on various factors, including the type of cancer, the extent of the spread, and how well the cancer responds to treatment. In many cases, metastatic cancer is not curable, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prolong life.

7. **Importance of Early Detection**:
   - Early detection and treatment of primary cancer can help prevent metastasis. Regular screenings and being aware of the symptoms of primary cancers are crucial.

In summary, "mets" refers to the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, a critical stage in cancer progression that influences treatment strategies and outcomes.
