  - port-wine nevus
---
### Definition:

A port-wine nevus, also known as a nevus flammeus, is ==a birthmark characterized by a flat, reddish-purple discoloration of the skin==. 

---
### Causes: 

Port-wine nevi are caused by an abnormal development of blood vessels in the skin during fetal development. This results in a permanent dilation and accumulation of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) in the affected area. 

---
### Appearance: 

Port-wine nevi typically appear as:

- Flat, well-defined patches of skin
- Reddish-purple in color, often resembling port wine

- Can vary in size and shape

- May become darker and more prominent over time 
---

### Location:

Port-wine nevi can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly found on the face, neck, eyelids, forehead, and limbs. 

---
### Diagnosis:

A port-wine nevus is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. 

---

### Treatment: 

Port-wine nevi are not typically harmful, but they can be a cosmetic concern. Treatment options include: 

- Laser therapy: Laser treatment can destroy the dilated capillaries, fading the discoloration. 

- Topical medications: Certain topical medications may help reduce redness and inflammation. 

- Surgery: In rare cases, surgery may be an option to remove the affected area. 

---
### Prognosis: 

Port-wine nevi are permanent and will not fade on their own. However, treatment options can effectively improve their appearance. It's important to note that some port-wine nevi may be associated with other medical conditions, such as [[Sturge-Weber syndrome]].
