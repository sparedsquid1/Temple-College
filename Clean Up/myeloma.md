Myeloma, often referred to as **multiple myeloma**, is a type of [[Blood]] cancer that originates in the plasma cells, a type of white [[Blood]] cell found in the bone marrow. Plasma cells are responsible for producing antibodies, which help the body fight infections. In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells multiply uncontrollably, leading to several health problems.

### Key Characteristics of Multiple Myeloma

1. **Abnormal Plasma Cells**: In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy [[Blood]] cells and produce an abnormal protein known as monoclonal protein, or M protein. This protein can cause damage to various organs, including the kidneys.

2. **Bone Damage**: The growth of myeloma cells can lead to bone destruction, causing bone pain, fractures, and high levels of calcium in the [[Blood]] (hypercalcemia).

3. **Anemia**: Due to the overcrowding of abnormal cells in the bone marrow, the production of normal [[Blood]] cells is reduced, often leading to anemia, which causes fatigue and weakness.

4. **Kidney Problems**: The excess M protein and high calcium levels can lead to kidney damage or failure.

5. **Increased Risk of Infection**: Since myeloma cells disrupt the normal production of antibodies, the immune system's ability to fight infections is compromised.

### Symptoms of Multiple Myeloma

- **Bone pain**, particularly in the back or ribs
- **Fatigue** and weakness due to anemia
- **Frequent infections** or slow recovery from infections
- **Hypercalcemia** symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and increased thirst
- **Kidney problems** or symptoms of kidney failure
- **Unexplained weight loss**

### Diagnosis

Multiple myeloma is typically diagnosed through a combination of tests, including:
- **[[Blood]] tests**: To detect high levels of calcium, M protein, and other markers.
- **Urine tests**: To check for the presence of Bence Jones protein, a type of M protein.
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: To assess the presence and extent of abnormal plasma cells.
- **Imaging tests**: X-rays, MRI, or CT scans to detect bone damage.

### Treatment

While multiple myeloma is currently considered incurable, it is treatable. Treatment options include:
- **Chemotherapy**: To kill or stop the growth of myeloma cells.
- **[[Corticosteroids]]**: To reduce inflammation and the growth of myeloma cells.
- **Targeted therapy**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that specifically target abnormalities in myeloma cells.
- **Immunotherapy**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that help the immune system identify and attack myeloma cells.
- **Stem cell transplant**: To replace diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.
- **Radiation therapy**: Used to shrink tumors or relieve pain in specific areas.

### Prognosis and Management

The prognosis for multiple myeloma varies depending on factors such as the stage of the disease at diagnosis, the patient’s overall health, and response to treatment. Advances in treatment have significantly improved survival rates and quality of life for many patients. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are crucial for managing the disease and detecting any potential complications or recurrence.

If you or someone you know is dealing with myeloma, it’s important to work closely with a healthcare team to develop an individualized treatment plan.
