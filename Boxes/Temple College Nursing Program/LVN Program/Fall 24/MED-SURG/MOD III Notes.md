- Integrase: Integrase inhibitors
- Replication: Prevented by NNRTI’s, NRTI’s
- Packaging
- Budding: Protease inhibitors
<!--SR:!2024-12-14,3,198-->

HIV Progression
?

5. Symptoms are of weakening immune system
6. AIDS

<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,178-->

## Chapter 18
[[Nursing Health and Illness II Chapt 18.pptx]]
Immune System Function, Assessment, and Therapeutic Measures

[[Blood]] Compatible
?![[DonorRecipient-Chart_1.jpeg]]
Antigens
?
Chemical markers that identify cells
Human cells have “self” antigens
Foreign cell antigens will not match
Recognized as foreign and destroyed
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,198-->

Lymphocytes
?
- Natural killer cells
- Thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells)
- Bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells)
- T cells and B cells
	- Each cell responds to one foreign antigen.
- T cells
	- Lymph nodes and nodules, spleen
- B cells
	- Plasma cells produce antibodies to specific foreign antigen.
	- Memory cells
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,178-->

Antibodies
?
Immunoglobulins (I g) or gamma globulins
Proteins produced by plasma cells in response to foreign antigens
Specific for only one antigen
Label antigens for destruction
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,198-->

Five classes of human antibodies
?

<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,178--> 

Two Mechanisms of [[Immunity]]
?
Cell-mediated [[Immunity]]
Humoral [[Immunity]]
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,198-->

Cell-mediated immunity
?
Recognition of foreign antigen by helper T cells (C D4)
Killer T cells lyse cells (C D8)
Memory T cells remember specific foreign antigens
Suppressor T cells limit immune response
<!--SR:!2024-12-14,3,218-->

Humoral [[Immunity]]
?
- Antibody-mediated [[Immunity]] recognition of antigen as foreign
- [[B cells]] proliferate and differentiate
	- Plasma cells producing antibodies that circulate forming an antigen-antibody complex
	- Memory [[B cells]]
- Antibodies label antigen for phagocytosis
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,178-->

Antibody Responses
?
- First exposure to foreign antigen stimulates antibody production in small amounts.
- Second exposure to antigen causes memory cells to make large amounts of antibody.
- Vaccines based on this principle
- Allergic responses when antibodies respond to foreign but harmless antigens
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,198-->

Types of [[Immunity]]

Passive [[Immunity]]
?
- Antibodies obtained outside person
- Temporary
- Naturally acquired
	- Placental transmission of antibodies
	- Antibodies in breast milk
- Artificially acquired
<!--SR:!2024-12-14,3,218-->

Active immunity
?
- Produces own antibodies
- Naturally acquired
	- Recover from disease, memory cells specific for that pathogen
- Artificially acquired
	- Vaccine
<!--SR:!2024-10-02,1,198-->

Diagnostic Tests
?
