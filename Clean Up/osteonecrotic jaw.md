Osteonecrotic jaw, also known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), is a severe bone disease that occurs when the jawbone starts to die due to a lack of [[Blood]] supply. Here are the key aspects:

1. **Pathophysiology**:
    - **Cause**: ONJ is often associated with the use of bisphosphonates or [[denosumab]], medications commonly prescribed for osteoporosis, bone [[mets]], and certain cancers. It can also occur after dental procedures, trauma, or in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
    - **Mechanism**: Reduced [[Blood]] [[flow]] to the jawbone leads to [[Bone Tissue]] death, resulting in exposed bone and failure to heal properly.

2. **Symptoms**:
    - **Pain**: Persistent pain or discomfort in the jaw.
    - **Exposed Bone**: Visible bone in the [[Mouth]], particularly in the jaw.
    - **Swelling**: Swelling of the gums and oral tissues.
    - **Infection**: Infected or inflamed gums, leading to abscesses or pus discharge.
    - **Loose [[Teeth]]**: [[Teeth]] may become loose or fall out.
    - **Difficulty Healing**: Delayed healing of the gums or other oral tissues after dental procedures.

3. **Diagnosis**:
    - **Clinical Examination**: [[identification]] of exposed bone in the oral cavity.
    - **Imaging**: X-rays, CT scans, or MRI to assess the extent of bone damage.
    - **Medical History**: Review of medications (especially bisphosphonates or [[denosumab]]), history of cancer treatment, and recent dental procedures.

4. **Treatment**:
    - **Conservative Management**: Includes oral rinses, antibiotics, and pain management to control infection and alleviate symptoms.
    - **Surgical Intervention**: In severe cases, surgical removal of necrotic bone may be necessary.
    - **Discontinuation or Adjustment of Medication**: Under medical supervision, discontinuing or adjusting the dosage of bisphosphonates or [[denosumab]].
    - **Dental Care**: Preventive dental care to minimize the risk of developing ONJ, including regular dental check-ups and avoiding invasive dental procedures when possible.

5. **Prevention**:
    - **Dental Evaluation**: Before starting bisphosphonate or [[denosumab]] therapy, patients should have a thorough dental examination and complete any necessary dental work.
    - **Good Oral Hygiene**: Maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental visits to prevent infections and complications.
    - **Avoiding Certain Procedures**: Limiting invasive dental procedures (like extractions) during treatment with high-risk medications.

Osteonecrotic jaw is a serious condition that requires careful management by a team of healthcare professionals, including oncologists, dentists, and oral surgeons, to prevent and treat complications effectively.
