Chronic intrauterine hypoxia refers to a prolonged deficiency of oxygen in the fetus during pregnancy. This condition can arise due to various factors such as placental insufficiency, maternal health issues, or restricted [[Blood]] [[flow]]. Over time, it may lead to developmental complications, affecting growth, organ function, and overall fetal well-being. In severe cases, it can result in preterm birth or long-term health problems for the child.

Explanation: Chronic intrauterine hypoxia is not a sudden event but a sustained lack of oxygen that impacts fetal development. It is significant because oxygen is crucial for normal growth and organ maturation. When the supply is limited, it disrupts normal fetal development, which is why it can have serious consequences for both immediate and long-term health.
