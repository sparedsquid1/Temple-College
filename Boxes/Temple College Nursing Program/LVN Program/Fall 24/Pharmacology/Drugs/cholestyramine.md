### Mechanisms of Action
#### Cholestyramine: Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Nursing Considerations

**Mechanism of Action (MOA):**

- Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant.
- It binds to bile acids in the intestines, forming an insoluble complex that is excreted in feces.
- This process reduces the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids.
- As a result, the liver increases the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, lowering serum cholesterol levels (particularly LDL cholesterol).

**Nursing Considerations:**

1. **Administration:**
    
    - Administer the medication with water or non-carbonated fluids to prevent choking or esophageal irritation.
    - Ensure it is taken at least **1 hour before** or **4–6 hours after** other medications to avoid drug interactions.
2. **Monitoring:**
    
    - Monitor lipid profiles (e.g., LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol) regularly to assess efficacy.
    - Watch for signs of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K), as absorption may be impaired.
3. **Adverse Effects:**
    
    - Common side effects include **constipation**, **bloating**, and **abdominal discomfort**.
    - Severe side effects may include **steatorrhea** or **intestinal obstruction** in rare cases.
4. **Dietary Education:**
    
    - Encourage a diet high in fluids and fiber to reduce the risk of constipation.
    - Educate patients to take vitamin supplements if advised by a healthcare provider.
5. **Patient Teaching:**
    
    - Advise patients about the importance of adherence to the prescribed regimen.
    - Inform them of the potential for delayed onset of effects, as cholesterol reduction may take several weeks.
6. **Special Populations:**
    
    - Use cautiously in patients with a history of **gastrointestinal obstruction** or severe **dysphagia**.
    - Monitor closely in pregnant or breastfeeding women, as bile acid sequestrants can interfere with nutrient absorption.
