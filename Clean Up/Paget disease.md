Paget disease, also known as Paget's disease, refers to two distinct medical conditions: Paget's disease of bone and Paget's disease of the breast. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Paget's Disease of Bone**:
    - **Definition**: A chronic disorder that can result in enlarged and misshapen bones. It typically affects the pelvis, skull, spine, and legs.
    - **Causes**: The exact cause is unknown, but it may be related to genetic factors or viral infections.
    - **Symptoms**: Bone pain, misshapen bones, fractures, and arthritis in the joints near affected bones.
    - **Diagnosis**: X-rays, bone scans, [[Blood]] tests (elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase), and sometimes a biopsy.
    - **Treatment**: Medications such as bisphosphonates to regulate bone remodeling, pain management, and sometimes surgery.

2. **Paget's Disease of the Breast (Paget's Disease of the Nipple)**:
    - **Definition**: A rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and usually associated with an underlying breast cancer.
    - **Causes**: The exact cause is not well understood, but it involves malignant cells known as Paget cells.
    - **Symptoms**: Eczema-like changes to the skin of the nipple and areola, including redness, flaking, itching, and possibly discharge or bleeding.
    - **Diagnosis**: Clinical examination, mammography, biopsy, and sometimes [[ultrasound]].
    - **Treatment**: Surgery (mastectomy or lumpectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, depending on the stage and [[nature]] of the underlying breast cancer.

Each type of Paget disease requires specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches tailored to the individual patient's condition.
