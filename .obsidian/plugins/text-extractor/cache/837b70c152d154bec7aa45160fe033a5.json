Objectives • Compare the biologic theories and physical changes of aging. • State how a person might behave in the psychosocial theories of aging. • Identify factors that contribute to longevity, disease prevention, health promotion, and restoration. • Discuss Schaie’s theory of cognitive and Erikson’s psychosocial developments in the older adult • Discuss lifespan variables affecting learning, such as stress, pain and fear. • Discuss health teaching, learning plans, and factors in the aging and end of life population Compare Theories of Aging Biological Theories Biological clock Free-radical theory • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UinagAaUxOU Wear-and-tear theory Immune system failure theory Autoimmune theory Psychosocial Theories • Disengagement theory • Activity theory • Continuity theory Matching • Biological Clock • Free-Radical • Wear-and-Tear • Immune system failure • Autoimmune • Disengagement • Activity • Continuity • Body cells are programmed to function for specific length of time • Body cells and organs eventually wear out • Body no longer recognizes itself and begins to attack itself and break down • Body cells are damaged by toxins, ions break off and result in unstable ions • Body cells and system lose ability to protect body from disease • Theory that people who remain interested and active will continue to enjoy life and live longer • Theory that it is normal for older people to withdraw from society • Theory that the individual continues to live and develop as the person they have been to cope with other stages of life Myths About Older Adults • Older adults are sick. • Older adults cannot learn new things. • It is too late for lifestyle changes to improve health. • Genetics are the main factor in longevity. • Older adults are not sexual. • Older adults are a drain on society. • Older adults are senile. • Older adults are typically isolated from their families. • Older adults usually live in nursing homes. • Older adults are poor. • Older adults are unhappy.
