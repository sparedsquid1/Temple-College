decreases tone, motility, and GI secretions. ▪ Beta 1: increases heart rate; increases force of myocardial contraction ▪ Beta 2: vasodilation of peripheral vessels; bronchodilation (lungs) o Epinephrine is a nonselective drug (acts on both alpha and beta receptors) ❖ Uses: shock, hypotension, allergic reactions, heart problems, bronchoconstriction or asthma attacks, superficial bleeding, nasal congestion, respiratory distress o Shock: inadequate state of tissue perfusion (brain activates the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal-system to release norepinephrine and epinephrine) ▪ Signs and symptoms • Integumentary: pallor, cyanosis, cold, clammy, sweating • CNS: agitation, confusion, disorientation, coma • CV: hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia’s, wide pulse pressure, gallop heart rhythm • Respiratory: tachypnea, pulmonary edema • Renal: urinary output <20 ml/hr • Metabolic (endocrine): acidosis ▪ BP: report any progressive decrease, a decrease in SBP <100 mm Hg, or a decreased of 20 mm Hg or more in client’s normal blood pressure ▪ Pulse: initially increases to compensate but then will diminish and patient will become bradycardic (less than 60 bpm) ▪ Hypovolemic: when blood volume is diminished (hemorrhaging, fluid loss due to burns, dehydration, excessive diuresis) ▪ Cardiogenic/obstructive: when cardiac output is insufficient and perfusion cannot be maintained (acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, severe cardiogenic shock) ▪ Distribution/vasogenic: changes to blood vessels leading to dilation with no additional blood volume; blood is redistributed • Septic shock: overwhelming infection (central line infection) • Anaphylactic shock: massive system vasodilation; occurs after the allergic reaction has occurred and shock sets in • Neurogenic shock: interference with PNS blood vessel control (spinal cord injury) ❖ Adverse reactions o Cardiac arrhythmias o Increased blood pressure ❖ Contraindications o Dopamine: unmanaged arrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation o Epinephrine: narrow-angled glaucoma;
