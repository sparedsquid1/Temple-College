Anti-VEGF (Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy is a treatment that inhibits the activity of VEGF, a protein that promotes the growth of new [[Blood]] vessels (angiogenesis). VEGF plays a key role in various physiological processes, including wound healing and the formation of [[Blood]] vessels. However, it also contributes to pathological conditions, particularly in diseases characterized by abnormal [[Blood]] vessel growth, such as cancer and certain eye diseases.

### Key Uses of Anti-VEGF Therapy:
1. **Cancer Treatment:**
   - Tumors require a [[Blood]] supply to grow and spread. By inhibiting VEGF, anti-VEGF therapies can starve tumors of the necessary nutrients and oxygen delivered by [[Blood]] vessels, thereby slowing or stopping tumor growth.
   - Examples: [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin), [[ramucirumab]] (Cyramza).

2. **Eye Diseases:**
   - **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** Anti-VEGF treatments help prevent abnormal [[Blood]] vessel growth in the retina, which can lead to [[Vision]] loss.
   - **Diabetic Retinopathy:** These treatments help reduce swelling and prevent further [[Vision]] impairment by reducing the leakage from [[Blood]] vessels in the retina.
   - Examples: [[ranibizumab]] (Lucentis), [[aflibercept]] (Eylea).

### Interactions:
Anti-VEGF [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] work by binding to VEGF molecules, preventing them from interacting with their receptors on the surface of cells. This inhibition reduces the formation of new [[Blood]] vessels in areas where they are not needed or are harmful, such as in tumors or in the retina.

### Side Effects and Considerations:
- **Common Side Effects:** Hypertension, bleeding, and gastrointestinal perforation (especially in cancer treatment).
- **Ocular Side Effects:** In eye treatments, there may be risks of eye infection, increased intraocular pressure, and in rare cases, retinal detachment.
- **Resistance:** Some tumors may develop resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, necessitating combination treatments or alternative strategies.

Anti-VEGF therapies have significantly advanced the treatment of certain cancers and eye diseases, improving outcomes and quality of life for many patients. However, they require careful administration and monitoring due to potential side effects and resistance.
