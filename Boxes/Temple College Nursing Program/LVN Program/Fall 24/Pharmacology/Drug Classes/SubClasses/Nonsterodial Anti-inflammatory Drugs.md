### Contraindications
The NSAIDs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity. There is a cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, meaning if a client is allergic to one NSAID, there is an increased risk of an allergic reaction with any other NSAID. Hypersensitivity to [[aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)]] is a contraindication for [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] NSAIDs. In general, NSAIDs are contraindicated during the third [[trimester]] of pregnancy and during lactation. Also, they are not to be used for postoperative pain following CABG surgery. Some NSAIDs are not used to treat rheumatoid arthritis or [[Osteoarthritis]]; these include [[ketorolac]], [[mefenamic]], and [[meloxicam]]. [[celecoxib]] is contraindicated in clients who are allergic to sulfonamides or have a history of cardiac disease or stroke. [[ibuprofen]] is contraindicated in those who have hypertension, peptic ulceration, or GI bleeding. Arthrotec combines [[diclofenac]] and [[misoprostol]] (abortifacient), and should not be taken by pregnant women.
