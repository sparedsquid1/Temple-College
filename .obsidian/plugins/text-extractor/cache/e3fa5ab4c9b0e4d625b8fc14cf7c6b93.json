The nurse is preparing to administer ranitidine to a client who is currently receiving warfarin. Which assessment finding should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Decreased white blood cell count B) Respiratory depression C) Increased bleeding D) Decreased seizures Answer: C Rationale: Histamine H2 receptor antagonists when given with warfarin place the client at an increased risk for bleeding. A decreased white blood cell count occurs when histamine H2 receptor antagonists are given with carmustine. An increased risk of respiratory depression occurs when histamine H2 receptor antagonists are given with opioid analgesics. This class of drugs does not interact with any antiseizure medications. There is a risk for toxic levels of antiseizure drugs when used concomitantly with proton pump inhibitors.
