In medical terms, BUN stands for [[Blood]] Urea Nitrogen. It is a measure of the amount of urea nitrogen in the [[Blood]], which is a waste product formed in the [[Liver]] from the breakdown of proteins and is excreted by the kidneys. The BUN test is used to evaluate kidney function. High levels of BUN may indicate impaired kidney function, dehydration, or other health issues, while low levels can be seen in severe [[Liver]] disease or malnutrition.
