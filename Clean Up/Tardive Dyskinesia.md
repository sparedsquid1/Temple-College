A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary movements. TD is characterized by rhythmic, involuntary movements of the [[Tongue]], face, [[Mouth]], or jaw and sometimes the extremities. The [[Tongue]] may protrude, and there may be chewing movements, puckering of the [[Mouth]], and facial grimacing. TD is a late-appearing reaction and may be observed in clients receiving an antipsychotic drug or after discontinuation of antipsychotic drug therapy.
