Status asthmaticus is a severe and potentially life-threatening form of asthma where a person experiences a prolonged and severe asthma attack that does not respond to standard treatments, such as inhaled [[Bronchodilators]] and [[Corticosteroids]]. This condition requires immediate medical attention and often hospitalization, as it can lead to [[Respiratory]] failure. Symptoms may include severe shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, and an inability to speak in full sentences.
