Rule #5: Double Check Your Work +Does your answer make sense? +Is your decimal in the right place? +12.5 mL VS 1.25 mL Wrong math can lead to client demise 4/17/2024 7 Chapter 6 Metric and Household Measurements Metric System Expressed in decimals; not fractions Conversions can be made by moving decimal places 4/17/2024 8 Metric Conversion +Weight (grams) +Volume (liters) +Length (meters) Conversions 4/17/2024 9 Metric to Household Measurements Metric Measure Household Measure 5 milliliters (mL) 1 teaspoon (tsp) 15 milliliters (mL) 1 tablespoon (Tbsp) 30 milliliters (mL) 1 fluid ounce (oz) 240 milliliters (mL) 1 standard measuring cup 1 kilogram (kg) or 1000 grams (g) 2.2 pounds(lb) 2.5 cm 1 inch 12 inches = 1 foot Chapter 7 Calculations Used in Client Assessments 4/17/2024 10 Weight +1 kilogram (kg) or 1000 grams (g) = 2.2 pounds (lb) +Ex: A child weights 22 lb. To find their weight in kg you divide lb by 2.2. The child would weigh 10 kg. +If starting in kg and need to convert to lb, you multiply by 2.2. Calculating Intake and Output + Intake: Liquid that go into the client orally or intravenous (IV) + If it is liquid at room temperature it counts + Output: Liquid expelled from the body + Urine, Drains, Emesis Add up all the input for the shift Add up all the output for the shift 4/17/2024 11 Converting Temperature Fahrenheit - Celsius 1. Subtract 32 2. Divide by 1.8 Celsius = (F-32)/1.8 Celsius - Fahrenheit 1. Multiply by 1.8 2.

The drug is supplied in 250 mg tablets. How many tablets will the nurse administer? 500 mg x 1 tablet = X 250 mg 2 x 1 tablet = 2 tablets Practice +The health care provider orders Thorazine 20 mg po Q4h. The drug is available in 120 mL bottles of Thorazine syrup containing 10 mg/5mL. How many milliliters will the nurse administer? 20 mg x 5 mL = X 10 mg 2 x 5 mL = 10mL 4/17/2024 17 Practice with Converting Measures kg g mg mcg +A health care provider ordered Amoxicillin 0.5 g po four times a day. The drug is supplied in 500 mg capsules. How many capsules would the nurse administer? +0.5 g become 500 mg 500 mg x 1 capsule = X 500 mg 1 x 1 capsule = 1 capsule Proportion Method +If one chicken can lay 3 eggs, how many chickens do you need in order to have 51 eggs? 1 chicken = X(chicken) Then cross multiply 3 eggs 51 eggs 3x = 51 (divide by 3 on both sides to isolate the x) 3 3 X = 17 chickens 4/17/2024 18 Proportion Method +The health care provider orders NS 300 mL to infuse over 20 minutes. The nurse sets the pump at how many mL/h? 300 mL = x(mL) 20 minutes 60 minutes 20x = 18,000 20 20 X = 900 mL/h Chapter 15 Intravenous (IV) Flow Rates 4/17/2024 19 IV Flow Rates +Most intravenous medications administered on an IV pump are given in milliliters per hour (mL/h). +Example: Normal Saline 500 mL to infuse over 5 hours. How many mL/hour would you program the pump for? 500 mL = 100mL/h 5 hours Practice +Infuse 1,000 mL of Lactated Ringer’s solution over 12 hours. How many milliliters per hour should the IV pump be programmed for? 1000 mL = 83.33 = 83 mL/h 12 hours 4/17/2024 20 Practice +Infuse 750 mL of Lactated Ringer’s solution over 8 hours. How many milliliters per hour should the IV pump be programmed to deliver? 750 mL = 93.75 = 94 mL/h 8 hours Drops Per Minute +IV medications administered without a pump, by gravity, are administered in drops per minute (gtt/min) +Used in med/surg, critical care, and pediatric units, as well as in operating rooms and in ambulatory care settings +You will be given the drop factor (number of drops contained in 1 mL) +Formula: Total volume to be infused x Drop factor = x gtt/min Total amount of time in minutes 4/17/2024 21 Drop Factor +Drop factor = gtt/mL +Drop is stated on IV tubing package +Macrodrop factors = 10, 15, 20 gtt/mL +Microdrop factor = 60 gtt/mL +When the drop factor is 60 gtt/mL the gtt/min and mL/hr are the same Practice +The health care provider has ordered normal saline 150 mL to run over 60 minutes. The drop factor is 10 gtt/mL. Calculate gtt/min. 150mL x 10 = 25 gtt/min 60 min","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
