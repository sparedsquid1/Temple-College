### Mechanisms of Action
#### Codeine: Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Nursing Considerations

**Mechanism of Action (MOA):**

- Codeine is a **prodrug** that is metabolized in the liver (via CYP2D6 enzyme) into morphine, its active form.
- It acts as an **opioid receptor agonist** (primarily at the μ-opioid receptors) in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to:
    - Pain relief (analgesia)
    - Suppression of the cough reflex (antitussive effect)
    - Sedation

---

**Nursing Considerations:**

1. **Assessment:**
    
    - Assess the patient’s pain level and respiratory status prior to administration.
    - Monitor for signs of respiratory depression (e.g., slow breathing, hypoxia).
    - Check for history of hypersensitivity to opioids.
2. **Dosing and Administration:**
    
    - Follow prescribed dose carefully to avoid **overdose**.
    - Administer with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset.
    - Avoid use in pediatric patients under 12 years or in breastfeeding mothers due to risk of serious adverse effects.
3. **Side Effects:**
    
    - Common: Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
    - Serious: Respiratory depression, hypotension, and risk of dependency or misuse.
4. **Patient Education:**
    
    - Instruct the patient to avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking codeine.
    - Encourage fluid intake and dietary fiber to prevent constipation.
    - Caution about potential for drowsiness or impaired coordination; avoid driving or operating machinery.
5. **Monitoring:**
    
    - Observe for signs of **toxicity** (e.g., pinpoint pupils, severe respiratory depression).
    - Monitor bowel function for constipation, which may require intervention.
    - Evaluate pain relief and adjust therapy as needed.
6. **Contraindications and Cautions:**
    
    - Contraindicated in patients with respiratory conditions such as severe asthma or COPD.
    - Use cautiously in elderly patients or those with renal or hepatic impairment.
