Demonstrate measuring and recording vital signs 2. Describe significance of normal and abnormal vital signs 3. Differentiate between comprehensive assessment, focused assessment, and an initial head-to-toe shift assessment 4. Perform a head-to-toe assessment identifying the significant of abnormal assessment findings. 5. Describe adaptations in assessment techniques that are necessary due to the age of the client Vital sign changes during blood loss: -tachycardia (1st sign) -tachypnea -hypotensive -hypothermic ****signs of hypovolemic shock**** (ex: GI bleed, hemorrhaging) Measuring Vital Signs: Temperature ❖ Normal range is 97.5-99.5 F ❖ Metabolism- produced by body heat ❖ Fever- increase in metabolism when pathogens invade; body (immune system) produces substances to destroy the pathogens (increased activity) o Pyrogens-agents that cause fever (bacteria) o Pyrexia- occurs when temp rises to 100.2 F or higher o 3 stages of fever- onset, febrile (body temp rises to a new set point), defervescence ▪ Afebrile- no fever o Fever patterns- constant (>14 hrs), intermittent, remittent (will not fall to normal), relapsing (falls to normal then rises again) ❖ Factors that affect temperature o Time of day o Environmental temps o Sunburn (temperature lowers to try and cool body down) o Age o Physicality o Menstrual cycle/ovulation o Emotions/stress o Disease/illness o Drugs ❖ Basal metabolic rate- heat produced when body is at rest; when increased, it leads to great O2 demand which leads to a fever o Affected by thyroid hormone ▪ Hyperthyroidism (increase in BMR)-EXCESSIVE heat ▪ Hypothyroidism (decrease in BMR)-LOW heat o Other hormones: epinephrine, norepinephrine, testosterone ❖ Hypothalamus- control center (feedback mechanism, body’s thermostat) o Increased body heat causes vasodilation (causes diaphoresis) o Decreased body heat causes vasoconstriction (shivers) ❖ Heat loss o Evaporation- sweat comes from skin is transferred into the air o Conduction-warm skin touches cool object and heat is lost; ice bags applied to skin increases heat loss ❖ Hyperthermia- temp 100.2 F (not significant until 101.3 F) o Can be due to brain injury (malfunctioning hypothalamus) o Temps greater than 105.8 F ▪ Damage to cells (central nervous system) ▪ Leads to dehydration (fluid loss), delirium, convulsions if temperature stays high for extended periods; seizures are a huge concern o Nursing care- keep linen dry, light clothing, medications (Tylenol/acetaminophen), limit activity, increase oral intake to at least 2000 mL ❖ Diaphoresis- excessive sweat production when body temp rises above set point ❖ Hypothermia-lowered temperature throughout the entire body o Possibly leads to fatigue or coma due to reduced cellular activity and less heat being produced o Those at risk- post op, infants, elderly, homeless, critically ill o Nursing care- reduce heat loss, raise room temp SLOWLY (avoid risk of irregular heart rhythm and shock), eliminate drafts, head covered, warm blankets and fluids, increase muscle movement, submerge frostbite areas in warm bath water (no higher than 107 F) ❖ Chills- rapid muscle contraction and relaxation in hopes of producing heat when body is too cold o May signify onset of fever or increase of core temp ❖ Lifespan considerations o Older adults lose body heat quickly just like infants do o Older adults may not exhibit fevers due to body temp not being able to rise ❖ Ways to measure temp- oral, axillary, tympanic, temporal, rectal, disposable, infrared o Axillary- 1 degree LOWER than oral o Tympanic- core temp; SAME as oral; up &back for adults, down & back for under the age of 2 o Rectal- core temp; RED TIPPED; 1 degree HIGHER than oral; use with babies o Temporal- less common; 1 degree HIGHER than oral; ICU or pedi Blood Pressure Systolic Diastolic Normal Under 120 Under 80 Prehypertension 120-139 80-89 Hypertension stage 1 140-159 90-99 Hypertension stage 2 Above 160 Above 100 Hypertensive crisis Above 180 Above 110 Blood Pressure ***amount of forced being placed on arterial blood*** Systolic- max pressure exerted on artery during left ventricular contraction Diastolic- lower pressure exerted on artery when heart is at rest (between contractions) ❖ Affecting physiological factors o Blood volume ▪ Increase in volume (overhydration) leads to increased BP (more pressure on walls) ▪ Decreased blood volume (trauma/blood loss or dehydration) leads to decreased BP o Blood consistency (viscosity) ▪ Increase in thickness leads to increased BP (more pressure to pump) o Bood wall elasticity (peripheral vascular resistance) ▪ Decreased elasticity leads to atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries) which leads to increased BP (harder to push through rigid vessels) o Stroke volume- amount of blood ejected from heart in one contraction o Cardiac output- amount of blood heart pumps out in 1 minute ▪ CO increases, BP increases & CO decreases, BP decreases o Vasoconstriction- blood vessel resistance which causes higher BP o Vasodilation- blood vessel relaxation which causes lower BP ❖ Affecting factors o Time of day (lowest at night and at rest) o Exercise causes BP to rise due to greater need for oxygen o Lying down will cause a low BP o Head injuries such as increased ICP leads to increased BP and pulse pressure o Age- Infants have low BP & older adults have high BP (due to loss of elasticity) o Stress- BP increases due to hormones, stimulation, and vasoconstriction o Vasodilation- parasympathetic; dilated vessels due to relaxation or hot temps o Vasoconstriction-sympathetic; constricted vessels due to stress or cold temps o Medications o Gender ▪ Males normally have higher BP (until age 45) ▪ Menopause women have higher BP (65 and older) ▪ African American women are known to have high BP ❖ Pulse pressure- difference between systolic and diastolic ❖ Hypertension o Risk factors- men under 45 or women over 65, stress, unhealthy lifestyle o Populations at risk- African American women, males, menopausal women, diabetic patients o Can damage brain, kidneys, hearts, retinas, and lead to strokes ❖ Hypotension o Can mean circulatory collapse (SHOCK)- hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, myocardial infarction (heart attack) o Other signs of SHOCK- increased pulse, cold/clammy skin, dizziness, blurred vision, apprehension (REPORT IMMEDIATELY) ❖ Orthostatic hypotension- drop in BP when changing from supine to standing o Due to- medications, neurological problem, dehydration o How to measure- take BP (and pulse) when supine then when standing ▪ Classification- A drop of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic (and if pulse increases by at least 20 bpm) ❖ Korotkoff sounds o Phase I: tapping (systolic pressure) o Auscultatory gap: NO SOUND; older adults with hypertension will have this o Phase II: murmur or swishing sounds that increase as cuff is deflating o Phase III: knocking o Phase IV: muffling (diastolic pressure in children) o Phase V: disappearance of sound (diastolic pressure in adults) Pulse (pressure wave) ❖ Controlled by cardiac contractions, initiated by SA’s electrical impulse o Arterial walls expand to accept an increase in pressure (pulsations) ❖ Affecting physiological factors o Age (pulse diminishes as we get older) o Body build and size o Blood pressure (increased BP leads to decreased pulse & vice versa) o Drugs (stimulants and depressants) o Emotions (anxiety stimulates the sympathetic nervous system) o Blood loss (body tries to meet tissue oxygen demands) o Exercise o Increased body temp (1 degree= 7-10 beats) o Pain ❖ Stroke volume- volume of blood pushed into aorta during each heartbeat (60-70 mL) o Affect pulse’s character (ex: weak pulses indicate falls in stroke volumes) ❖ Blood amount & degree of vasodilation or vasoconstriction also affects pulse ❖ Cardiac output- amount of blood pumped by left ventricle in 1 minute (pulse x SV) o Average is 5 mL ❖ Ways to measure pulse-radial (most common), temporal, carotid, femoral, apical (apex of heart), popliteal, and pedal (dorsalis pedis); any superficial artery o Pedal pulse- determines blockage; difficult to locate so doppler may be needed o Apical pulse (point of maximum impulse-PMI)- mitral valve ▪ Location- halfway between left midclavicular line and left nipple (5th ICS) ▪ Counted for a full minute ▪ Always taken over radial if a child is younger than 2 years old or if adult presents with irregular rhythm or irregular radial ❖ Rate- tachycardia and bradycardia o Normal is 60-100 bpm (average is 72) o Pulse deficit- when there is a difference between apical and radial ▪ 2 nurses, 1 watch, 1 stethoscope ▪ Apical minus radial pulse ▪ Can indicate atrial fibrillation ❖ Characteristics- rhythm, volume, strength o Arrythmia- irregular pulse due to stress, heart disease, or side effects of med o Strength ▪ Absent: 0 (non-palpable or heard) ▪ Weak: 1+ (poor force) ▪ Normal: 2+ (moderate force) ▪ Bounding: 3+ (even beats and strong force) Respirations ❖ Controlled in respiratory center by pons and medulla in the brainstem ❖ Exchange of O2 and CO2 in lungs and tissues (breathing) o External respiration ▪ Ventilation- mechanical movement ▪ Dispersion of air throughout bronchial tree ▪ Diffusion of O2 and CO2 across alveolar membrane ▪ Perfusion- movement of blood o Internal respiration- O2 released from Hgb and the cell releases CO2 ❖ Organs- nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi/bronchioles (carry O2 throughout body), and lungs (3 on right and 2 on left) o Alveoli-gas exchange; tiny, thin-walled sacs ▪ Surfactant- reduce surface tension (helps with expansion) ❖ Respiratory patterns: o Eupnea- normal rate and breathing o Tachypnea- increased o Bradypnea- slow and regular o Kussmaul- fast and deep; diabetic patients & kidney failure o Biot- equal depth with apneic periods o Apnea- absence o Cheyne-stokes- faster and deeper then slow and shallow; end of life ❖ Patient with respiratory complications- abnormal breath sounds, dyspnea, decreased activity tolerance Pain ❖ 5 th vital sign ❖ Scale, type, location, duration Assessing Health Status: Subjective data- what patient SAID; described (symptoms; headaches, fear, nausea, pain) Objective data- OBSERVED (signs; vital signs, bruises, appearance) Order of assessment: inspect, auscultate, palpate, percuss, olfaction (smell) ***never palpate before auscultating because it could interfere with patient’s baseline Head-to-Toe Assessment ❖ Holistic care- formulate effective nursing care plans ❖ Weight should be CONSISTENT (same time of day; with or without shoes; dry weight) ❖ General appearance, behavior, orientation ❖ Signs and symptoms of abuse o Children o Adults ❖ Skin (color, turgor, intactness, lesions, temperature, moisture) o Primary skin lesions ▪ Macules-flat areas (freckles, petechiae) • Petechiae-pinpoint round purplish red spots that are flat ▪ Papules- elevated solid lesions (warts, moles) • Nodules- greater than 0.5 cm ▪ Vesicles- superficial collections of serous fluid (herpes zoster/shingles, varicella/chickenpox, 2nd degree burns) ▪ Plaques- elevated, superficial solid lesions (psoriasis) ▪ Wheals- firm, edematous areas (insect bites, urticaria) ▪ Pustules- elevated, superficial lesions filled with purulent fluid (acne, impetigo) ❖ Head and neck (symmetry, PERRLA, nose, mouth, and ears) o PERRLA- pupils equal round reactive to light & accommodation o Glasgow coma scale (helps identify neurological conditions) ❖ Chest and thorax o Spine (normally midline, concave, convex) ▪ Lordosis- exaggerated lumbar curve (pregnant women, weight gain) ▪ Kyphosis- increased curve in thoracic area (with aging) ▪ Scoliosis- pronounced lateral curvature of spine (born with it) o Heart sounds ▪ Aortic (right side 2nd ICS) • Systolic murmur (aortic stenosis, aortic valve sclerosis, flow murmur) ▪ Pulmonic (left side 2nd ICS) • Systolic ejection murmur (flow murmur, pulmonic stenosis) ▪ Tricuspid (left side 3rd ICS) • Diastolic murmur (atrial septal defect, tricuspid stenosis) • Holosystolic murmur (tricuspid regurgitation, ventricular septal defect) ▪ Mitral (left side 5th ICS)- PMI; apex of heart • Apical pulse- listen for one full minute o Lung sounds- always compare each side when listening ▪ 2 lobes on left (due to heart) ▪ 3 lobes on right ▪ Normal • Bronchial- over trachea; low pitched • Bronchovesicular- 1 st and 2 nd ICSs & over scapula; medium pitched • Vesicular- peripheral lungs; low pitched ▪ Abnormal • Wheezes- whistling sounds; partial obstruction (asthmatic, COPD patients) • Rhonchi/gurgles- dry rattling sounds (pneumonia) • Crackles/rales- fine or course nonmusical sounds heard during inspiration; sounds like hair rubbing next to ear (pneumonia)t • Stertor- snoring sound; unable to cough up secretions; obstruction; • Stridor-crowing/croaking sound; obstruction of upper airway (croup) • Pleural friction rub- scratchy sound due to pleural membranes rubbing over each other o How to get the best lung expansion- sit upright (fowlers) ❖ Abdomen o Bowel sounds & habits o Urinary sounds & habits o Auscultation in all 4 quadrants (order- RLQ, RUQ, LUQ, LLQ) ▪ If no bowel sounds present, listen for 5 minutes before taking next step ▪ No bowel sounds indicate a blockage and patient would need surgery","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
