Elevated blood pressure is found in over 90% of patients acutely, even in absence of history of hypertension. uncontrolled hypertension smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure aphasia, contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, visual field defects, and gaze deviation towards the bleed have a variable prognosis, with a significant risk of mortality and long-term disability, but some individuals can recover and regain independence Hemiparesis – Weakness of the face, arm, and leg on the same side Ataxia – Staggering, unsteady gait. Unable to keep feet together; needs a broad base to stand. Dysphagia – Difficulty in swallowing (Smeltzer & Bare, 2004, p. 1905 Preventing sudden systemic hypertension is critical in hemorrhagic stroke management. The goal of therapy is to maintain the systolic blood pressure at about 150mm Hg. The patient is closely monitored for neurologic deterioration occurring from recurrent bleeding, increasing IP, or vasospasm. A neurologic flow record is maintainted. The blood pressure, pulse, LOC, pupillary responses and mortor funcion are checked hourly.
