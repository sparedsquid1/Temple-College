### Adverse Reactions 
The adverse reactions that may result from the administration of glucocorticoids are given in [[Box 41.2]]. Long- or short-term high-dose therapy may also produce many of the signs and symptoms seen with Cushing syndrome, a disease caused by the overproduction of endogenous glucocorticoids. Some of the signs and symptoms of this Cushing-like (cushingoid) state include a buffalo hump (a hump on the back of the neck), moon face, oily skin and acne, osteoporosis, purple striae on the abdomen and hips, altered skin pigmentation, and weight gain. When a serious disease or disorder is treated, it is often necessary to allow these effects to occur because therapy with these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] is absolutely necessary.

### Contraindications
Glucocorticoids are contraindicated in clients with serious infections, such as tuberculosis and fungal and antibiotic-resistant infections. Glucocorticoids are administered with caution to clients with renal or hepatic disease, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease, [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]], hypertension, osteoporosis, convulsive disorders, or diabetes. Glucocorticoids are classified as [[Preg Cat C]] [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and should be used with caution during pregnancy and lactation. Clients taking ACTH should avoid any vaccinations with live virus. The live virus [[Vaccines]] can potentiate virus replication with ACTH, increase any adverse reaction to the vaccine, and decrease the clientâ€™s antibody response to the vaccine. 

Multiple drug interactions may occur with the glucocorticoids. [[Table 41.2]] identifies selected clinically significant interactions.
