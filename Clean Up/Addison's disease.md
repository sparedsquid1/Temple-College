- Low mood
- Loss of appetite and weight loss

- Dizziness
- Fainting
- Cramps
- Darkened skin, lips, or gums

Causes 

- Autoimmune diseases that cause the immune system to attack the adrenal glands
- Infections like tuberculosis that destroy the adrenal glands
- Cancer that spreads to the adrenal glands
- Bleeding into the adrenal glands
- Genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands
- Certain medications

Treatment 

- Taking corticosteroid medicines like hydrocortisone, [[prednisone]], or [[methylprednisolone]] to replace [[cortisol]]
