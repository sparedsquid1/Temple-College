Identify patient populations at an increased risk for infection 4. Differentiate between the use of medical and surgical asepsis 5. Demonstrate the application of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions while caring for patients Ch 16: Infection Prevention & Control ❖ Infection: entry of infectious agents, microorganisms, into body that disrupts tissue integrity o Pathogens: cause disease and illness o Nonpathogenic organisms: normal flora (found in vagina) o Release toxins and endotoxins ❖ Bacteria: single-celled, lacks nucleus; reproduce rapidly o Oxygen ▪ Aerobic: needs oxygen to grow and thrive ▪ Anaerobic: only grow without oxygen o Shape: cocci, bacilli, spirochetes o Gram stain ▪ Gram positive: retains stain ▪ Gram negative: loses stain • More dangerous (more severe and threatening because may produce endotoxins that can lead to hemorrhagic shock) o Treatment: antibiotics, cultures/sensitivity tests (shows which antibiotics work and can kill certain bacteria), wash hands ▪ Prevention: keep cuts clean and covered, avoid sharing belongings, avoid contact with wounds o Multidrug resistant organisms (KNOW THESE) ▪ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ▪ Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) ▪ Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) ▪ Clostridium Difficile (C.diff) ▪ Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia ❖ Prions: protein particles that lack nucleic acids o Cannot be destroyed by normal methods that destroys bacteria o No triggered immune response o Causes degenerative neuro diseases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is human version of “mad cow disease”) ❖ Protozoa: one-celled o Pathogenic to humans (malaria, dysentery, diarrhea-causing strains) ❖ Viruses: can only be seen with electron microscope o Composed of particles of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) with a protein coat o Grows and replicates only with living cells o Cannot be treated with antibiotics; must pass through the body o Nurse role: manage symptoms (immodium for diarrhea, tylenol for headache) (“make it rain from the bootyhole” -mere) ❖ Rickettsia: round or rod-shaped; very small organisms o Transmitted through lice, ticks, fleas, mites (found in yard) o Multiply only in host cells o Can cause rocky mountain spotted fever and typhus (scabes which is a form of body lice; causes a rash) ❖ Fungi: no chlorophyll; reproduces by spores o Examples: yeasts and molds (due to moist environments) ▪ Fungal infections in humans are “mycoses” ❖ Helminths: parasitic worms or flukes, roundworms, and tapeworms o Pinworms (affect children mostly) are most common worldwide o Can be found in sheets, blankets, etc. ❖ Mycoplasmas: very small; no cell wall o Can cause respiratory or genital tract infections (ex: mycoplasma pneumonia) ❖ Chlamydia: more common in last 20 years (“the clap” -mere) o Affects genitourinary and reproductive tracts ❖ Process of Infection o Causative agent: microorganism/biologic agent that causes disease ▪ 4 stages: incubation, prodrome, illness, convalescence ▪ Ways to remove link: disinfection (clean equipment) & sterilization (autoclaves-use of extreme heat to kill of bacteria) o Reservoir: where micoorganisms live and thrive ▪ Ex: wounds, waste, animals (turtles are known to spread salmonella), insects, contaminated food or water, infected persons ▪ Ways to remove link: standard precaution, hand hygiene, sterility when necessary o Portal of exit: route where pathogen leaves host ▪ GI, respiratory tracts, skin, mucous membranes, blood ▪ Ways to remove link: identify and treat infected person; isolation techniques and barrier precautions o Mode of transfer: how pathogens spread ▪ Direct contact (most common is via hands) ▪ Indirect contact (formites: needles, hospital equipment, dressings, clothing, eating utensils) ▪ Vectors (insects, mosquitos, fleas, ticks) ▪ Droplet (sneezing, coughing) ▪ Ways to remove link: hand hygiene, disinfection and sterilization, aseptic technique, education, standard precautions, insect control, air filters • Wash hands for at least 30 secs to be effective o Portal of entry: route where pathogen enters host ▪ Mucous membranes, consuming contaminated food or water, breathing in pathogenic droplets, broken skin (non-intact) ▪ Ways to remove link: sterile or clean items, barrier precautions, safe handling of food or water, good hygiene, avoid risky behavior (sex), protection from insect bites o Susceptible host: susceptibility depends on age, state of health, or broken skin (know table 16.3 & 16.4 on p. 227; 16.5 on p. 228) ▪ Factors: poor nutrition, inadequate hygiene, impaired mobility, chronic illness, physiological changes • Babies: haven’t built up immunity yet • Older adults: harder to fight off diseases ▪ Ways to remove link: good health and hygiene habits, immunizations, aseptic techniques, barrier precautions, and protective isolation, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, decreased stress ❖ Defenses against infections o Primary (skin is first line) ▪ Intact skin prevents pathogens from going in; sebaceous glands try to push pathogens out) ▪ Mucous membranes (mouths, eyes, nose, ears, cilia, resp and repro tracts, lysosomes) ▪ Stomach (hydrochloric acid- breaks down and kills bacteria) ▪ Liver (kupffer cells-detoxify toxic chemicals) ▪ Intestines (feces- flush out bacteria) ▪ Urine (severe acidic pH prevents infections because it flushes out bacteria) o Second (fever) ▪ Temperature of 101 F or higher slows growth or kills many pathogens (creates harmful environment for germs) ▪ Leukocytes-increases WBCs (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils) • WBC count: determines the kind of infection (bacterial, viral, or parasitic) ▪ Phagocytosis: macrophages ▪ Inflammation: mechanical, chemical, or infection (p. 229) • Dilation of blood vessels- blood rushes to area; redness, warmth, swelling/edema; increases WBCs • Histamine and serotonin- blocks pathogen from going other places besides localized area • Fibrinogen- promotes clotting and walls of area of injury • Pus- purulent drainage made up of WBCs and debris • Goals/purpose- neutralize and destroys harmful agents, limit spread to other tissues in body, prep the damage tissues for repair ▪ Interferon: antiviral o Third (immune response) ▪ Leukocytes and macrophages localize; antigens attach ▪ Antigen-antibody response: antigens are specific to certain microorganisms which create antibodies to help prevent future infections ▪ Immunoglobulins: contain antibodies that comes from people or animals; injected into patients with a need for immediate protection from organisms ▪ Types of immunity: • Naturally-acquired: develops from previous infection (chickenpox) • Artificially-acquired: immunizations prompt body to produce antibodies (Hep B, influenza, tetanus) • Passive-acquired: immunoglobulins; short-lived; protection from current invasion (tetanus antitoxin) • Naturally-acquired passive: placental transmission; short-lived (breastfeeding) ❖ Asepsis: making environment free of microorganisms o Medical: reducing number of organisms present to reduce risk of infection (clean technique-dressing change, home care, hand hygiene) o Surgical: prevents exposure to living microorganisms (sterile- catheters/epidurals/central lines, sterilization-autoclaves) ▪ Perform 5 minute hand scrubbing ▪ Use sterile PPE ▪ Sterilize all instruments and inanimate objects used in surgery ▪ Maintain sterile technique while in operating room ▪ 4 rules- know what is sterile, know what is not sterile, separate sterile from unsterile, remedy contamination immediately ▪ Sterile gloving- sterile to sterile and unsterile to unsterile ❖ Hand hygiene: most effective way to reduce number of microorganisms o Perform hand hygiene every time gloves come off (the standard) o Can wash 5 times with alcohol-based sanitizer before washing with soap and water (15-30 seconds at least) o Protects patient and nurse o C. diff and yeast infections- must wash hands with soap and water ❖ Standard Precautions: developed by CDC to break chain of infection (“universal precautions”) o Every patient, every encounter o PPE (when necessary) ▪ Gowns, mask/goggles, head covers, shoe covers o Safe handling of sharps and contaminated waste o When coughing, cough away from area into the bend of your arm ❖ Lifespan considerations o Older adults: more at risk for infection due to less active immune system and slower healing process ❖ Latex allergy o Aways know which reaction your patient has o Most common is dermatitis (itchy rash) o More serious is hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic reactions which can cause swelling and more serious symptoms) ❖ Sharps o NEVER recap needles o ALWAYS dispose in sharps container o NEVER overfill container o In case of accidents, clean and notify management immediately ▪ If in contact with human skin, clean with soap and water ❖ Contaminated waste o Body fluids go in red biohazard bags o Soiled linens- hold away from your body ❖ Cleaning o Clean instruments BEFORE you send them to the autoclave ❖ Disinfection: chemical, hard surfaces o A 1:10 solution of chloride bleach and water can be used on counters and bathrooms ❖ Antisepsis: reducing organisms on skin ❖ Decontamination: cleaning process ❖ Sterilization: elimination of all organisms by heat, gas, or chemicals o Most effective way to destroy all microorganisms is to expose them to moist heat at high temperatures for 16-20 minutes Ch 17: Infection Prevention & Control in the Hospital & Home: ❖ 4 stages of infection o Incubation: time from exposure to development of symptoms; when viruses are transmitted o Prodromal: short time from onset of vague nonspecific symptoms until specific symptoms start to present; most infectious o Illness: greatest symptoms arise o Convalescent: recovery ❖ Types of infections o Primary & secondary o Localized: one part of body o Systemic: when infection spread to other parts of the body o Septicemia: “sepsis”; when infection reaches bloodstream; life threatening ❖ HAIs (healthcare associated infections) o Infection that wasn’t present or incubating when patient was admitted o Also known as “nonsocomial infections” o Patients at risk: surgical incisions, artificial airways, foleys, prosthetics, repeated lab draws, lower immunity ▪ Remember how portal of entry includes open/broken skin o 40% are caused by poor hand hygiene o Examples: ▪ CLASBIs- sterile technique is a MUST, assess for infections ▪ CAUTIs- only when needed, sterile technique for placement; closed system, keep drainage bag below bladder ▪ VAP- keep HOB elevated, PUD and DVT prophylaxis, daily oral care with chlorhexidine mouth rinse ▪ Pneumonia (due to stasis; no movement is taking place)- turn cough and deep breath, splinting techniques, incentive spirometers ❖ Infection Control o No shaving, only clipping at the site only o Preoperative prophylactic antibiotics ▪ Discontinue after 24 hours so resistance doesn’t develop o Emphasis: containing microorganisms and preventing their spread ▪ Greatest risk of transmission is from DIRECT CONTACT by caregivers' hands or contaminated equipment/supplies o Isolation measures must be followed when necessary ▪ Always use standard precautions even if you are using transmission-based precautions as well (slide 17) ❖ Infection Preventionist (IP): investigates all HAIs o Educates & is responsible for ensuring infection prevention and control measures are being followed ❖ CDC/OSHA: provides guidelines for nationwide healthcare facilities o Primary goal: protect all patients, workers, family members and social contacts in all settings o Responsible for needless systems (meds given through IV sites) ❖ PPE (personal protective equipment) o Donning order: gown, mask/respirator, goggles, gloves o Doffing order: gloves, goggles, gown, mask/respirator ▪ When taking mask off, untie bottom ties first, then the top o Remove before leaving the room & clean hands directly after o Examples ▪ Bed bath- gloves ▪ Trach suctioning- gloves, mask/goggles, gown possible ▪ Transporting patients in general- nothing ▪ Spurting of blood- gloves, fluid resistant gown, mask/goggles or face shield ▪ Drawing blood for labs- gloves ▪ Taking pulse of a patient who is perspiring- gloves ▪ Cleaning patient with diarrhea: gloves and gown preferably ▪ Irrigating a wound: gloves, gown, mask/goggles or face shield ▪ Taking vitals: nothing o ❖ Transmission based precautions o Contact: spreads through direct contact ▪ Hand hygiene with sanitizer, gown, gloves ▪ Ex: e.coli, scabies, staph, herpes, MDRO, MRSA, VRE o Extended contact: same as contact except must use soap and water ▪ Used with c.diff infectious diarrhea (spore forming bacteria) o Droplet: transmitted through cough, sneeze, or talking ▪ Hand hygiene, mask ▪ Ex: flu, pertussis, pneumonia (streptococcal is common), mumps, rubella (german measles) o Airborne: transmitted through air/breathing ▪ N95 mask respirator (must be fitted) ▪ Negative airflow rooms ▪ Ex: measles (rubeola), TB, varicella (chickenpox/shingles), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) ❖ Guidelines for isolation precautions o Use of separate BP cuff and stethoscope designated to that patient o Clean other equipment after leaving the room o Can only share rooms if both patients have the same infection o When transporting patients, be sure they have a surgical mask on o Physiological aspects ▪ Isolating disease, not the patient ▪ Visitors are allowed but must follow precautions ▪ Listen to pt and always check on them with interaction ▪ Never make patient feel “dirty” ❖ Protective environment (“reverse isolation” or neutropenic precautions) o For severely immunocompromised patients- neutropenic patients ▪ Bone marrow transplants, chemo patients o Protects patient from others with infections o No fresh fruits or flowers, no sick visitors, strict handwashing ❖ Infection prevention in the home setting o Wash hands!!!!! o Routinely clean surfaces (kitchen and bathroom) o Handle and prepare food safely o Immunizations o Antimicrobial use as prescribed by PCP o Be careful with pets due to spread of germs o Avoid contact with wild animals","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
