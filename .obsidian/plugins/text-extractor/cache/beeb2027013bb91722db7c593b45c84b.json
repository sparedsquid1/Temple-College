{"path":"Boxes/ChelseaFiles/Pharm Exam 1-Copy(1).pdf","text":"Pharmacology Exam 1 (Mod I & Mod II) Module I Chapter 1: General Principles of Pharmacology (12 questions) ❖ Naming drugs o Chemical: scientific name; exact chemical structure o Generic: official name; not owned by agency (ex: loratadine/ diphenhydramine) o Trade: brand name; registered by manufacture (ex: Claritin/ Benadryl) ❖ Drug administration: o Oral drug phases ▪ Pharmaceutic: solid form dissolves and liquid forms (only for tabs/caps) ▪ Pharmacokinetic: absorption, distribution, metabolism, & excretion ▪ Pharmacodynamic: agonist vs antagonist • Agonist: binds/stimulates receptor (therapeutic; happy response) • Antagonist: joins but no stimulation; prevents drug response (unhappy response) o Liquid drug phase ▪ Only go through the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phases ▪ Skips the pharmaceutic phase ▪ Is absorbed quicker ❖ Pharmacokinetics o Absorption: by small intestines, then transported into body fluids ▪ First-pass effect: liver first metabolizes most of the drug then it’s circulated through the body • Remaining may not be therapeutic enough which may require a higher dosage o Distribution: determining factors include blood flow, solubility, protein binding o Metabolism: “biotransformation”; drug becomes less active so it can be excreted o Excretion: after drug goes through liver, it enters kidneys to be excreted ▪ Remember that kidney failure pts may need lower dosages ▪ Half-life: time required for body to eliminate 50% of the drug; drugs with shorter half-lives are given more frequently • Difficulty excreting may increase half-life and is at risk of toxicity ❖ Drug interactions o Pregnancy ▪ Teratogens: substances that cause abnormal development of fetus and often leads to severe deformation or fetal death o Breastfeeding (remember many drugs are excreted through breastmilk) o Drugs ▪ Additive: combined effect when taking two drugs together (ex-heparin and alcohol will increase bleeding risk) ▪ Synergistic: effects of both drugs are greater than each separately (ex- taking hypnotic with alcohol will increase hypnotic drug; can be fatal) ▪ Antagonistic: one interferes with other drug or neutralizes the effects (ex- protamine and heparin taken together will neutralize heparin and cause blood clots) o Food/juice ▪ Grapefruit usually always interferes with medications ❖ Drug reactions o Adverse drug reaction: undesirable; mild, severe, or life-threatening (ex-nausea) o Allergic drug reaction: hypersensitive response of immune system (ex-wheezing, anaphylactic shock) ▪ Angioedema: localized wheels in subQ tissue or mucous membranes; may be caused due to allergic response o Drug idiosyncrasy: any unusual or atypical reaction to a drug (ex-hypnotic drug that instead causes alertness and excitement) ❖ Nursing implications o Know why you’re giving a drug o Know important facts before you administer (allergies, vitals, labs) o Know signs to observe for after giving (ALWAYS REASSESS) o Use nursing judgement ▪ Think ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) ❖ Factors influencing drug response: Body System Changes Children/Infants Adults Gastric Activity Higher pH; slower emptying Higher pH; slower emptying Skin Faster absorption Decreased absorption Body Water Content Increased; greater dilution of drug Decreased; greater concentration of drug Liver function Immature; increased half- life and less first-pass Decreased blood flow; delayed and decreased metabolism Kidney function Immature; decreased elimination; risk for toxicity with lower drug levels Decreased renal mass and GFR; increased serum levels of drug ❖ Terms to know: o Bioavailability: proportion of drug available to body tissues when it reaches the circulatory system o Drug tolerance: decreased response to a drug that requires an increase in dosage to help achieve desired effect (may help with opioids or antianxiety drugs) o Cumulative drug effect: when body is unable to metabolize and excrete a normal dose of a drug before the next dose is given (helps with kidney/liver diseases) ▪ Risk for toxicity (may need a lower dosage) o Metabolite: inactive form of original drug o Physical dependency: withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation o Psychological dependency: compulsive use without any true pain ❖ Herbal therapy: use of plants and herbs to treat disorders (“herbalism”) o Refer to CAM therapies o Always ask about herbal remedies the patient is taking; medications can still interact with natural substances/treatments ❖ Schedule of controlled substance o I: highly abusive; severe dependency (heroin, cannabis/marijuana, ecstasy) o II: potential for high abuse with severe physical/psychological abuse (opioids such as Vicodin, Adderall, cocaine) o III: less abusive; mod to low dependence (testosterone, ketamine, synthetic THC, tylenol with codeine) o IV: less abusive; limited dependence potential (benzos, sedatives, anxiety agents like Valium or Ativan, nonopioid analgesics, diet drugs o V: limited abuse potential (small dose of opioids like codeine, Lomotil, Lyrica) ❖ FDA pregnancy risk categories: o A: well controlled; no increased risk of fetal abnormalities o B: no evidence of harm to fetus; no well-controlled studies about mom o C: nothing has been conducted study wise o D: risk to fetus; potential benefits may outweigh the risks o X: fetal abnormalities or risks; contraindicated in pregnant women o N: no classified by the FDA Chapter 4: The nursing Process (1 question) ❖ Assessment o Pt's knowledge of drug regimen o Monitor for adverse reactions ❖ Diagnosis (most common) o Health-seeking behavior o Altered health management (ineffective health management) o Deficient knowledge o Noncompliance o Anxiety ❖ Planning o Make sure it’s a SMART goal (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) o Develop teaching plan to correct deficient knowledge or figure out reason for noncompliance ❖ Implementation o Perform nursing actions before administering drug o Remember 6 rights o Manage adverse reactions ❖ Evaluation o Effectiveness of interventions to meet patient goals o Effectiveness of drug regimen and pt/family understanding Chapter 5: Client and Family Teaching (6 questions) ❖ Health literacy: ability to understand information about health and disease in order to use it to make decisions about healthcare o Higher rates of limited health literacy: geriatrics, low income, non-english speaking, deaf or hard of hearing, no high school diploma, immigrants, unemployed o Behaviors of limited health literacy: incomplete medical forms or inaccurately filled out, frequently missed appointments, not following directions, inability to give name of medication and purpose, cannot describe when/how to take prescribed meds, no change in lab tests after “taking” medication o How to improve it: no medical jargon, use translators, figure out what type of learner your patient is ▪ 3 learning styles: visual, auditory, kinesthetic ▪ 3 domains of learning: • Cognitive (relies on past experiences)- use pamphlets • Affective (attitudes, feelings, beliefs, opinions)- use pamphlets or discussions/conversations • Psychomotor (physical skills or tasks)- use demonstration ▪ Make sure the patient is motivated!!! ❖ Cultural competency: always remember the cultural norms so that you can identify certain acceptable behaviors ❖ Limited English Proficiency (LEP) o Use written instructions that have been translated o Never use family members (they could paraphrase or leave out important information) o Never use patient’s children (don’t burden them with having to share the bad news or embarrassing details of a diagnosis; it’s unfair) ❖ Brown bag review: simple method to identify clients with limited health literacy o Ask client to bring all meds to clinic/appointment o Ask client to name each med and explain its purpose and how it’s to be taken o Listen to how client responds to questions about how to take the med o Reframe the question if it sounds like the client has simply memorized the medication instructions ❖ Considerations when developing a drug teaching plan o Take with full 8oz glass of water o Do not crush or chew (unless stated otherwise) o Same dose/same time o Take full prescription o Call PCP with questions o Do not change or add a dose (report any differences) o Tell all your providers what meds you are taking (keep a list) o Wear a MedicAlert bracelet (especially for anticoags, steroids, insulins, etc.) o Report all adverse drug reactions and report all allergies o Never take a family member’s prescription o Keep in original container from which it’s purchased with original label on ❖ Prepare patient/family for home drug administration o Develop a clear, easy to read drug schedule o Use a daily calendar o Refer to drug by shape or color if other teaching about drug names is unsuccessful o Number bottles and use a drug chart for reference as to which is which o Suggest a drug organizer (small fishing/tackle box) o Keep away from children o If refrigeration is necessary, store in Ziploc baggie o Keep supplies in one area and have a safe disposal for needles/sharp objects o Explain how to dispose of unused medication (do not flush down toilet or drain) ❖ Evaluate effectiveness of teaching o Use the teach-back method (client uses their own words to speak the information back to the nurse) Module II Chapter 6: Antibacterial drugs (7 questions) Sulfonamides ❖ Primarily bacteriostatic (slows growth down;
