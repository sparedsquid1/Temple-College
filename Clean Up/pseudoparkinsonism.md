Pseudoparkinsonism, also known as drug-induced parkinsonism, is a condition where an individual exhibits symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, but these symptoms are not caused by the neurodegenerative disorder itself. Instead, they are a side effect of certain medications or other underlying conditions.

### Symptoms of Pseudoparkinsonism
The symptoms mimic those of Parkinson's disease and may include:
- **Tremors**: Involuntary shaking, often in the hands.
- **Bradykinesia**: Slowness of movement.
- **Rigidity**: Stiffness in the muscles.
- **Postural Instability**: Difficulty maintaining balance and a tendency to fall.
- **Facial Masking**: Reduced facial expression.

### Common Causes
Pseudoparkinsonism is most often associated with the use of certain medications, particularly:
- **Antipsychotic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]**: These are the most common culprits, especially older, first-generation [[Antipsychotics]] (e.g., [[haloperidol]], [[chlorpromazine]]). Even some newer, [[SGA]] can cause it.
- **[[Antiemetics]]**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] used to treat nausea and vomiting, such as [[metoclopramide]].
- **[[Calcium channel blockers]]**: Medications used to treat high [[Blood]] pressure and [[Heart]] conditions.

Other possible causes include exposure to toxins, brain injuries, or metabolic disturbances, although these are less common.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves ruling out Parkinson's disease and identifying the medication or factor causing the symptoms. A healthcare provider may adjust or discontinue the offending medication to see if the symptoms improve.

### Treatment
- **Discontinuation or Adjustment of Medication**: If a medication is causing the symptoms, reducing the dose or switching to a different drug can often reverse the condition.
- **Antiparkinsonian Medications**: In some cases, [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like anticholinergics or [[amantadine]] may be prescribed to manage symptoms, but they are typically used only temporarily.
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up is essential to ensure symptoms improve after adjusting medication.

Pseudoparkinsonism is generally reversible once the offending drug is discontinued or adjusted, though this may take some time. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of pseudoparkinsonism, itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
