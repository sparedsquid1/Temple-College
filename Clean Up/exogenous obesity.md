Exogenous obesity refers to a type of obesity primarily caused by external factors, particularly an excessive caloric intake that surpasses the body's energy expenditure. This form of obesity is not driven by genetic or metabolic disorders but rather by lifestyle choices, such as overeating, lack of physical activity, and consuming high-calorie, low-nutrient foods.

Exogenous obesity differs from endogenous obesity, which is often linked to genetic, hormonal, or metabolic factors. In exogenous obesity, the weight gain is mainly due to the overconsumption of calories from the diet, leading to the accumulation of body fat. Managing exogenous obesity typically involves lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and behavioral interventions.
