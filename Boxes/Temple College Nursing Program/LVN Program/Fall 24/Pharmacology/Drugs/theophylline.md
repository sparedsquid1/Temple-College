### Mechanisms of action
#### Theophylline: Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Nursing Considerations

##### Mechanism of Action (MOA)

Theophylline is a **methylxanthine** derivative that exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Bronchodilation**:
    
    - Inhibits **phosphodiesterase (PDE)**, leading to increased levels of **cyclic [[adenosine]] monophosphate (cAMP)**.
    - Elevated cAMP levels relax smooth muscle in the airways, causing bronchodilation.
2. **Anti-inflammatory Effects**:
    
    - Modulates the release of inflammatory mediators, reducing airway inflammation.
3. **[[CNS]] and Cardiovascular Stimulation**:
    
    - Stimulates the [[CNS]] and increases [[Respiratory]] drive.
    - Enhances diaphragmatic contractility, improving [[Respiratory]] function.
4. **Other Effects**:
    
    - May have mild diuretic properties by acting on renal tubules.

##### Nursing Considerations

1. **Monitor Therapeutic Levels**:
    
    - Narrow therapeutic range (**5â€“15 mcg/mL**).
    - Levels above 20 mcg/mL can lead to **toxicity** (e.g., nausea, vomiting, seizures, arrhythmias).
2. **Assess for Adverse Effects**:
    
    - **Common**: Nausea, vomiting, restlessness, insomnia.
    - **Serious**: Tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, and seizures.
3. **Drug Interactions**:
    
    - Metabolized by the [[Liver]] (**CYP1A2 enzyme**).
    - Avoid or monitor with [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that inhibit or induce this pathway (e.g., **[[ciprofloxacin]]** increases theophylline levels, while **[[rifampin]]** decreases levels).
4. **Avoid [[caffeine]]**:
    
    - [[caffeine]] increases the risk of [[CNS]] stimulation and side effects.
5. **Assess for Smoking History**:
    
    - Smoking induces metabolism of theophylline, reducing its efficacy. Dosage adjustments may be necessary if the patient starts or stops smoking.
6. **Administer with Food if GI Upset Occurs**:
    
    - Can cause gastric irritation; take with meals or a full glass of water if necessary.
7. **Patient Education**:
    
    - Teach patients to recognize signs of toxicity (e.g., vomiting, restlessness, rapid [[Heart]] rate).
    - Advise adherence to prescribed dosages and regular [[Blood]] level monitoring.
8. **Contraindications and Precautions**:
    
    - Use cautiously in patients with **cardiovascular disease**, **seizure disorders**, or **peptic ulcers**.

By managing theophylline therapy carefully, nurses can optimize its therapeutic effects while minimizing potential risks.
