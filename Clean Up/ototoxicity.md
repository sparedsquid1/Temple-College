Ototoxicity refers to ear poisoning, where certain medications or chemicals cause damage to the inner ear, leading to hearing loss, balance disorders, or tinnitus (ringing in the ears). This damage can be temporary or permanent and can affect one or both ears.

### Causes of Ototoxicity
1. **Medications:** Some [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are known to be ototoxic, including:
   - Aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., [[gentamicin]], [[tobramycin]])
   - Chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., [[cisplatin]], [[carboplatin]])
   - [[Loop diuretics]] (e.g., [[furosemide]])
   - [[Salicylates]] (e.g., [[aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)]]) in high doses
2. **Chemicals:** Exposure to certain chemicals, such as solvents or heavy metals, can be ototoxic.
3. **Infections:** Severe infections affecting the ear can sometimes lead to ototoxic effects.
4. **Age and Genetics:** Older adults and individuals with a genetic predisposition may be more susceptible to ototoxicity.

### Symptoms
- Hearing loss (ranging from mild to profound)
- Tinnitus (ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the ears)
- Vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness)
- Imbalance or difficulty walking

### Diagnosis
- **Hearing Tests:** Audiometry tests can measure the extent of hearing loss.
- **Balance Tests:** Tests such as electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) assess balance and vestibular function.
- **Medical History:** Reviewing the patient's medication use and exposure to ototoxic substances.

### Treatment
- **Discontinuation of Ototoxic Agents:** Stopping or reducing the dose of the offending medication or substance.
- **Hearing Aids:** For those with permanent hearing loss, hearing aids can improve hearing ability.
- **Cochlear Implants:** In cases of severe hearing loss, cochlear implants may be considered.
- **Vestibular Rehabilitation:** Therapy to help manage balance disorders.
- **Monitoring:** Regular [[Hearing and Balance]] assessments for individuals at risk of ototoxicity.

### Prevention
- **Use of Alternative Medications:** When possible, using non-ototoxic alternatives.
- **Dose Management:** Using the lowest effective dose of ototoxic medications and monitoring [[Blood]] levels.
- **Hydration and Nutrition:** Ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition to support overall ear health.
- **Protective Measures:** Using protective equipment to avoid exposure to ototoxic chemicals.
