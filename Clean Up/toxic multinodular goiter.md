Toxic multinodular goiter is a condition characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) with multiple nodules that produce excessive amounts of thyroid [[Hormones]], leading to hyperthyroidism. In this condition, some of the nodules within the thyroid become overactive and secrete thyroid [[Hormones]] independently of the normal regulatory mechanisms of the body.

Key features of toxic multinodular goiter include:

- **Goiter:** The thyroid gland is enlarged, and multiple nodules (lumps) are present within it.
- **Hyperthyroidism:** The overactive nodules produce too much thyroid hormone, leading to symptoms such as weight loss, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, tremors, and increased sweating.
- **Older Age:** Toxic multinodular goiter is more common in older adults, especially in areas where iodine deficiency is common.
- **Gradual Onset:** Symptoms of hyperthyroidism may develop slowly over time, often less dramatically than in other forms of hyperthyroidism, such as [[Graves' disease]].

Treatment options may include antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine therapy to shrink the nodules and reduce hormone production, or surgery to remove part or [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] of the thyroid gland if the goiter is large or causing compression symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or breathing.
