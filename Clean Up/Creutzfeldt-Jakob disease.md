**Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare, degenerative, and fatal brain disorder caused by an abnormal form of the prion protein. It is characterized by rapid progression of cognitive decline, memory loss, and motor dysfunction.

**Causes:**

1. **Prion protein:** CJD is caused by a misfolded form of the prion protein (PrP), which is normally found in the brain.
2. **Genetic mutations:** Some cases of CJD are inherited due to genetic mutations that affect the PrP [[gene]].
3. **Environmental factors:** Exposure to contaminated tissue, such as infected meat or surgical instruments, can also cause CJD.

**Symptoms:**

1. **Cognitive decline:** Memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with speech and language.
2. **Motor dysfunction:** Tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with coordination and balance.
3. **Visual disturbances:** Blindness, double [[Vision]], or blurred [[Vision]].
4. **Seizures:** Seizures can occur in some cases.

**Diagnosis:**

1. **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:** A thorough medical history and physical examination are necessary to diagnose CJD.
2. **Imaging studies:** MRI or CT scans may show characteristic changes in the brain, such as atrophy or lesions.
3. **Biopsy:** A brain biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm the diagnosis.

**Treatment:**

1. **Supportive care:** Management of symptoms and discomfort, such as pain relief and physical therapy.
2. **Experimental treatments:** Some experimental treatments have shown promise in slowing disease progression, but more research is needed.

**Prevention:**

1. **Avoiding contaminated tissue:** Healthcare professionals should take precautions when handling tissues from patients with CJD or other prion diseases.
2. **Proper sterilization:** Surgical instruments and equipment must be properly sterilized to prevent transmission of the disease.

**Statistics:**

* **Incidence:** Approximately 1 in 1 million people per year develop CJD worldwide.
* **Mortality rate:** The mortality rate for CJD is nearly 100%, with most patients dying within a few months to a few years after symptoms begin.

**Interesting facts:**

* **Mad cow disease:** CJD can be transmitted through contaminated beef products, such as mad cow disease.
* **VCJD:** Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare form of CJD caused by consuming contaminated beef products.
* **Prion diseases:** CJD is one of several prion diseases that affect humans and animals, including scrapie in sheep and BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle.
