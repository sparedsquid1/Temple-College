Intestinal amebiasis is an infection caused by the parasite *Entamoeba histolytica*. This parasite can invade the intestines, leading to symptoms like diarrhea (sometimes with [[Blood]] or mucus), abdominal pain, and nausea. In severe cases, it can cause dysentery or lead to complications like [[Liver]] abscesses. The infection is typically spread through contaminated food or water. Treatment usually involves specific antibiotics or anti-parasitic medications to eliminate the parasite.
