Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of voluntary muscles. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies that block or destroy many of the muscles' receptor sites for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter necessary for muscle contraction.

### Key Features of Myasthenia Gravis:

1. **Symptoms:**
   - Muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest.
   - Drooping of one or both eyelids (ptosis).
   - Blurred or double [[Vision]] (diplopia).
   - Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).
   - Shortness of breath.
   - Impaired speech (dysarthria).
   - Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck.

2. **Causes:**
   - Autoimmune response: The bodyâ€™s immune system mistakenly attacks the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
   - Thymus gland abnormalities: Some people with MG have an enlarged thymus gland or thymomas (tumors of the thymus).

3. **Diagnosis:**
   - Neurological examination: Assessing muscle strength and fatigue.
   - [[Blood]] tests: Detecting antibodies against acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK).
   - Electromyography (EMG): Measuring electrical activity between the brain and muscles.
   - Edrophonium test: Injecting a drug called edrophonium chloride to see if muscle strength improves.
   - Imaging: CT scan or MRI to check for thymus gland abnormalities.

4. **Treatment:**
   - Medications: Anticholinesterase medications (e.g., [[pyridostigmine]]) to improve communication between nerves and muscles, [[Immunosuppressants]] (e.g., [[prednisone]], azathioprine) to reduce the immune response.
   - Thymectomy: Surgical removal of the thymus gland, which can improve symptoms in some cases.
   - Plasmapheresis: A procedure that removes antibodies from the [[Blood]].
   - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg): Provides normal antibodies that modify the immune response.

5. **Prognosis:**
   - With treatment, most people with MG can significantly improve their muscle strength and lead normal or nearly normal lives.
   - The course of the disease varies; some people may go into remission temporarily or permanently.

### Important Considerations:
- MG is not inherited or contagious.
- It can affect people of any age, but it is most commonly seen in women under 40 and men over 60.
- Stress, illness, and certain medications can exacerbate symptoms.

Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is crucial to manage the condition effectively and adjust treatments as needed.
