Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy welts or swellings that appear on the skin. These welts can vary in size and shape and often appear suddenly. Urticaria can be acute, lasting less than six weeks, or chronic, persisting for more than six weeks.

### Causes of Urticaria
1. **Allergic Reactions:** Common triggers include foods (such as nuts, shellfish, eggs), medications (like antibiotics, [[aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)]]), insect stings, and latex.
2. **Non-Allergic Causes:** Factors such as stress, infections, exercise, cold or heat exposure, and sunlight can also trigger urticaria.
3. **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Sometimes, chronic urticaria is associated with autoimmune disorders, thyroid disease, or infections.

### Symptoms
- Red or skin-colored welts that may vary in size and can merge to form larger areas.
- Intense itching.
- Swelling, which can occur on the face, lips, throat, or other parts of the body (known as [[angioedema]]).

### Treatment
- **Antihistamines:** These are the first line of treatment to relieve itching and reduce the appearance of welts.
- **Avoiding Triggers:** Identifying and avoiding known triggers can help prevent outbreaks.
- **Medications:** In more severe cases, doctors may prescribe [[Corticosteroids]], leukotriene inhibitors, or other medications to manage symptoms.
- **Lifestyle Changes:** Wearing loose-fitting clothes, avoiding hot showers, and applying cool compresses can provide relief.
