(CHILD VS. ADULT) ▪ Bone not completely ossified ▪ Periosteum is thicker ▪ Callus formation is faster ▪ Stronger due to lower mineral content ▪ Damage at epiphyseal plate ▪ Interferes with longitudinal growth THINGS TO OBSERVE ▪ Spinal Curvature ▪ “C” in newborn ▪ Double “s” in childhood ▪ Gait ▪ Muscle tone ▪ Neurological exam ▪ Diagnostic testing 2/12/2025 3 PEDIATRIC TRAUMA ▪ Soft tissue injuries ▪ Contusions ▪ Sprains ▪ Strains PEDIATRIC TRAUMA ▪ Fractures ▪ Simple ▪ Compound ▪ Greenstick ▪ Complete ▪ Spiral 2/12/2025 4 TYPES OF TRACTION ▪ Bryant’s – Figure 24-3 ▪ Buck’s ▪ Russell - Figure 24-4 ▪ Skeletal – Figure 24-6 CHECKLIST FOR TRACTION APPARATUS Weights hanging freely Weights out of reach of the child Ropes on the pulleys Knots not resting against pulleys Bed linens not on traction ropes Countertraction in place Apparatus does not touch foot of bed 2/12/2025 5 CAST AND SPLINTS ▪ Can be made from a variety of materials ▪ Child is at increased risk for ▪ Impaired skin integrity ▪ Compartment syndrome ▪ Progressive loss of tissue perfusion because of an increase in pressure caused by edema or swelling that presses on the vessels and tissues ▪ If not carefully monitored, significant complications can occur. NURSING CARE OF A CHILD IN A CAST ▪ Elevate effected extremity on a pillow. ▪ Perform frequent neurovascular checks. ▪ Teach cast care and how to support cast, safe transfers to or from chair or bed, how to use crutches safely, and when a cast is too loose or too tight. 2/12/2025 6 COMPARTMENT SYNDROME Pressure within one or more of the muscle compartments of the extremity compromises circulation resulting in an ischemia edema cycle with compromised neurovascular status ▪ Increased pain that is unrelieved with elevation or medication ▪ Intense pain when passively moved ▪ Paresthesia or numbness ▪ Pallor Nursing: ▪ Monitor and notify MD if compartment syndrome is suspected ▪ Loosen the constrictive dressing or cut bandage or tape ▪ Elevate the extremity and apply ice ▪ Prepare for a fasciotomy VOLKMANN’S ISCHEMIA 2/12/2025 7 NURSING CARE ▪ Neurovascular checks every 1-2 hours ▪ Peripheral pulse rate and quality ▪ Color ▪ Capillary refill time ▪ Warmth ▪ Movement and sensation ▪ Nursing Care ▪ Skin care ▪ Stool softeners ▪ Deep-breathing, coughing ▪ Pain control ▪ ROM ▪ Education MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS 2/12/2025 8 OSTEOMYELITIS Infection in the bone ▪ Causes ▪ Sign and Symtoms ▪ Pain ▪ Caused from exudate (pus) that collects under the marrow and cortex of the bone ▪ Muscle Spasms ▪ Inflammation ▪ Elevated WBC and ESR ▪ Treatment and Nursing care ▪ IV antibiotics – 4-6 weeks ▪ Wound care ▪ Immobilization ▪ Neurovascular checks ▪ No weight bearing ▪ Standard precautions DUCHENNE’S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Most common form of MD Treatment Supportive Quality of life Multidisciplinary team • Hypertrophy of calf muscles • Weakness • Clumsiness • Gower’s maneuver Manifestations • Creatinine phosphokinase • Muscle biopsy • Myelogram • ECG Lab 2/12/2025 9 Gower’s Maneuver Hypertrophy of calf muscle LEGG-CALVE’PERTHES Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head can be unilateral or bilateral ▪ Signs & Symptoms ▪ Painless limp ▪ Limited mobility ▪ Hip stiffness ▪ Diagnostic ▪ X-ray ▪ Bone scan ▪ Treatment ▪ Keep femoral head in hip socket – traction, casts ▪ No weight bearing ▪ Prognosis ▪ Spontaneous healing ▪ 2-4 years 2/12/2025 10 OSTEOSARCOMA Malignant tumor of the long bones ▪ Sign and Symptoms ▪ Pain ▪ Swelling at site ▪ Fracture ▪ Treatment/Nursing Care ▪ Radical resection ▪ Amputation ▪ Psychosocial needs EWING’S SARCOMA Malignant growth that occurs in the marrow of the long bones. ▪ Sign and Symptoms ▪ Pain ▪ Swelling at site ▪ Fracture ▪ Treatment/Nursing Care ▪ Radiation ▪ Chemotherapy ▪ No vigorous weight bearing ▪ Manage of side effects from treatment ▪ Education 2/12/2025 11 Osteosarcoma Ewings Sarcoma Onset 10-15 years of age 10-20 years of age Site Malignant tumor in long bones Malignant tumor in marrow of long bones Mets Usually to lungs** or other bones, brain Usually to lungs or other bones Symptoms Pain, swelling, fractures Pain, swelling, fractures Diagnosis Biopsy, CT, bone scan, X-ray Biopsy, CT, bone scan, X-ray Treatment Radical resection, Amputation Radiation, chemotherapy JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS • Joints • Connective tissues • Viscera Systemic Inflammatory disease • Systemic • Poly arthritis • Oligo Arthritis Types 2/12/2025 12 JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS Diagnosis • X-rays • Lab • Clinical manifestations • Aspiration of joint fluid Treatment/Nursing Care • Supportive • NSAIDS with food • Immune Suppressant medications • PT/OT/ROM • Education • Flat mattress • Resting splints-prevent flexion contractures • Moist heat and exercise • Plan rest periods during the day TORTICOLLIS (WRY NECK) Neck motion is limited and the cervical spine is rotated because of shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. ▪ Sign and Symptoms ▪ Holding head to side of involvement ▪ Chin tilted in opposite direction ▪ Palpable mass ▪ Treatment/Nursing Care ▪ ROM ▪ PT ▪ Surgery - > 2 years ▪ Supportive care 2/12/2025 13 SCOLIOSIS ▪ More common in girls ▪ Two types ▪ Functional—caused by poor posture ▪ Structural—caused by changes in the shape of the vertebrae or thorax ▪ Usually accompanied by rotation of the spine. ▪ Hips and shoulders may appear to be uneven. SCOLIOSIS TREATMENT • Curve < 20 degrees – close monitoring • Curve between 20-40 degrees • Milwaukee or Boston brace • Curves > 40 degrees – surgery Depends on extent of curvature Post-op care 2/12/2025 14 MILWAUKEE BRACE Should be worn approximately 16 to 23 hours a day and is worn over a T-shirt to protect the skin SCOLIOSIS NURSING CARE ▪ Annual screening ▪ Observe curvature and shape of back ▪ Asymmetry of the back while the child bend forward ▪ Prominent scapula ▪ One shoulder higher than the other ▪ Protruding hip ▪ One arm appears longer 2/12/2025 15 Boston brace Harrington rod SPORTS INJURIES ▪ Sports-specific examinations are given for those involved in strenuous activity on entry into middle school or high school. ▪ Common injuries include ▪ Concussion ▪ “Stingers” or “burners” ▪ Injured knee ▪ Sprain or strained ankle ▪ Muscle cramps ▪ Shin splints 2/12/2025 16 CHILD ABUSE ▪ Types of child abuse ▪ Emotional abuse: verbal acts destroys self-esteem ▪ Emotional neglect: intentional omission of verbal or behavioral actions ▪ Sexual abuse: involves acts performed on a child for sexual gratification of the adult ▪ Physical neglect: failure to provide for basic needs ▪ Physical abuse: deliberate infliction of injury Copyright © 2019, Elsevier Inc.
