SLOW GROWTH Malignant: disorganized tumors in body; cause harm if not treated; FAST GROWTH Metastasis: when malignant cells invade blood or lymph vessels Mechanical movement: something is “pushing” it Makes home in new location Most common sites: lungs, liver, bones, brain In situ cancer: remain localized; difficult to detect which is why they are identified though microscopic cell; removed and rarely need further treatment Cancer pathophysiology Many diseases with different causes (why it’s hard to find cure) Mutated cellular genes that lead to abnormal growth No cell division limit Lack of contact inhibition; cells don’t die (why there is different forms of treatment) Cancer etiology Carcinogens: substances or agents that increase risk of cancer development Three step process of growth and reproduction Initiation: altered DNA Promotion: tumor growth due to mutated cells (formation of tumor) Progression: growth and metastasis Cancer risk factors Oncoviruses: HPV virus (if males get vaccine, it protects the female); Epstein Barr, HIV Radiation: sun, tanning beds, xray, CT scans, MRIs Chemicals and irritants: smoke Genetics Diet: high fat/low fiber can lead to colon cancer; fatty foods can lead to prostate cancer Hormones: long term use of estrogen hormone; diabetes Immunity: chronic illnesses, stress, HIV, immunosuppressive meds after transplants Cancer types Carcinoma: skin, glands, digestive, urinary tract, respiratory tract (most common) Sarcoma: connective tissue, bone and muscle Leukemia: blood, plasma cells, bone marrow Lymphoma: lymph tissue, spleen Melanoma: skin cells Cancer prevention Early detection (remember “CAUTION” acronym) C- change in bowel or bladder habits A- a sore that won’t heal U- unusual bleeding T- thickening or lump I- indigestion or difficult swallowing O- obvious change in a mole N- nagging cough or hoarseness Regular screenings: mammograms, pap smears (baseline at age 21; if normal then every 5 years until 65), prostate/lung cancer screening Genetic tests Healthy lifestyle: smoking cessation Protectant foods: folate, fruits, veggies 2 ½ cups of fruits and veggies each day Limit red meat Decrease alcohol intake 150-300 minutes per week doing moderate to intense activity Limit sedentary activity Vaccines: hepatitis B vaccine protects against infection that increases susceptibility to liver cancer Diagnostic tests Biopsy: only accurate way to identify cancer VIA endoscope, surgical incision, or small needle inserted into site to get a sample of tissue or fluid Done in outpatient surgery or HCP office Radiological studies: detects cancer of bones or hollow organs, helps with staging Barium is given PO to visualize esophagus and stomach, can be given rectally to see colon, or can be pushed IV to see vessels, urinary tract, or fallopian tubes X rays, CT scans, mammography Can be outpatient or inpatient Nuclear imagining: detects sites of abnormal cell growth PET scans: provide cellular function; useful with brain imagining and detecting cancer spread Ultrasounds: detects tumors of pelvis, abdomen, heart, and breast; helps distinguish between benign and malignant Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): locates and stages malignant tumors in CNS, spine, head, breast, or musculoskeletal system Endoscopic procedures: direct visualization of body cavity or opening; helps surgeon with biopsy; detects lesions of throat, lungs, esophagus, stomach, colon Lab tests: tests via blood, serum, urine, etc; tumor markers help confirm a cancer diagnosis, detect origin, monitor effects, and help determine remission An increased WBC count without infection raises questions about leukemia Bone marrow aspiration: most common diagnosis of leukemia; learns numbers, shapes, and size of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets Cytological studies: studies formation, structures, and cell function; based on cell abnormality; significant cell changes could indicate and increase in cancerous activity Smeared cells that shed from mucous membranes are examined (cervical, oral, anal, or vaginal) Cancer staging (TNM is most common system) Tumor Well differentiated: neoplastic tumor resembling normal tissue; easy to treat Poorly differentiated: malignant neoplasm that contains mostly abnormal cells TX: primary tumor cannot be evaluated T0: no evidence of primary tumor Tis: carcinoma in situ (no spread yet) T1-T4: size and extent of primary tumor Nodes NX: regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated N0: no regional lymph node involvement N1-N3: involvement of regional lymph nodes Metastasis M0: no distant metastasis M1: distant metastasis Surgery: either done to cure or for comfort measures Radiation Side effects Fatigue (encourage naps and prioritize activities) N/V and anorexia Mucositis: inflammation of mucous membranes Xerostomia: dry mouth Desquamation: peeling skin (encourage to keep skin dry and irritant free) Bone marrow depression: low blood cells (possible blood administration) Hair loss Safety Time (work effectively/efficiently) Distance (remember radiation isotopes) Shielding (use barrier such as lead apron) Chemotherapy Action: cytotoxic meds (psychological age plays a huge role) Routes of admin: depends on size of patient and risk of toxicity; usually through port Vesicant drug: by IV into large vein (can cause necrosis if infiltration occurs) If noticed, STOP infusion, leave catheter in place, and leave catheter in place, then notify RN and HCP Oral an IV chemo has same potency Combo therapy (timing is important for drugs to work properly)- BITES accronym B- bleeding (suggests low platelet count) I- infection (suggests low WBC count) T- tiredness (suggest anemia) E- emesis (altered nutrition and electrolyte imbalance) S- skin changes (radiation reaction or skin breakdown) Side effects Bone marrow suppression at nadir (when cell counts are at its lowest;

keep vein open with normal saline High doses of diuretics may be ordered to wash out kidneys and promote urine flow Anaphylactic reaction: not common; due to sensitization to immunoglobulins passed through donor blood Stop infusion and stay with them; have someone else call RN and HCP CPR may be initiated until rapid response team or code team arrives After emergency has passes, pt may need transfusion from frozen deglycerolized blood cells Circulatory reaction: due to rapid infusion in short amount of time; more common in older or debilitated patients; Patient will have chest pain, cough, frothy sputum, distended neck veins, crackles and wheezes in lung fields, and tachycardia Stop infusion and notify HCP Diuretics will be ordered to help get rid of fluid Transfusion may be restarted at a slower rate Chapter 28: Care of the Client with Hematologic and Lymphatic Disorders (26 questions) Anemia Patho: deficient number of RBCs, Hgb, or both (impaired production, increased production, blood loss) Leads to a reduced capacity to carry oxygen to tissues Etiology: diet, hemolysis, hereditary disorders S/s: pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, irritability, fatigue, dyspnea Pernicious anemia: numb hands or feet, sore tongue Iron deficiency: mouth fissures, glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), spoon-shaped nails Diagnostic tests: CBC with microscopic exam, bone marrow analysis, tests to determine source of bleeding Check stool and urine color Interventions: eliminate cause, dietary change (choose foods with iron), supplements, transfusions, possible administration of oxygen Foods with iron: leafy greens, ice, liver or red meat Nursing diagnoses Activity intolerance: help patient conserve energy Imbalanced nutrition: educate about healthy foods Impaired oral mucous membrane integrity: Aplastic Anemia Patho: bone marrow cannot produce adequate RBCs because it’s fatty Always fatal if untreated Etiology: congenital, toxin exposure, chemotherapy S/s: weakness, fatigue, pallor, dyspnea, headache, ecchymoses, petechiae, frank bleeding (injection site oozing), infection, death Diagnostic tests: CBC, bone marrow biopsy, total iron-biding capacity (TIBC), serum iron Treatment: treat the cause, colony stimulating factors, steroids, bone marrow transplant Interventions: place on bleeding precautions, avoid use of drugs that interfere with platelet formation, minimize risk of infection (neutropenic precautions) Sickle Cell Anemia Patho: inherited autosomal recessive disorder Etiology: must have gene mutation form both mom and dad Crisis prevention: avoid risk of lowered O2 (cold exposure, infection, exercise), low dose-penicillin, frequent transfusions, hydroxyurea (drug that reduced crisis risk but can cause serious life-threatening effects) Dianostic tests: sickle Dex test, hgb electrophoresis, CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Crisis treatment: antibiotics (at risk for infection), pain management (opioids, PCA pump), transfusions, fluids, oxygen therapy S/s Brain: thrombosis, hemorrhage, stroke Heart: failure Abdomen: hepatomegaly, gallstones, splenic enlargement, splenic infarction Bones and joints: hand and foot syndrome Eye: retinal or conjunctival hemorrhage, blindness Lungs: atelectasis, infarction, pneumonia Kidney: diluted urine, diuresis, hematuria Penis: priapism Skin: stasis ulcers Nursing diagnoses Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion: remove constrictive clothing, avoid alcohol, cold exposure, smoking, avoid strenuous exercise, infections, unpressurized aircraft, administer oxygen, warm compress, avoid cold compress, IV fluids Acute pain: PCA pump, Tylenol for fever, avoid aspirin, encourage bedrest due to increased need for oxygenation Polycythemia Patho: overabundance of RBCs, Hgb <18 mg/dL, Hct >55%, blood is too thick Etiology Primary polycythemia: specific gene mutation Secondary polycythemia: due to long-term hypoxia S/s: HTN, headache, vision changes, vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus Von Willebrand: acquired bleeding disorder (retinal hemorrhaging, bloody gums, and nosebleeds), chest pain, external dyspnea, dark/flushed skin, itching (due to excess mast cells) Diagnostic tests: CBC, bone marrow aspiration Treatment: Phlebotomy, low dose aspirin, chemo and radiation Interventions: ROM exercises, increased fluids, avoid tight clothing, elevate feet, educate about reporting signs and symptoms of iron deficiency and bleeding Disseminated intravascular coagulation Patho: accelerated clotting, clotting factors become depleted, leads to excess bleeding (severe hemorrhaging);
