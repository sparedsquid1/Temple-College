Complementary modalities are added on to traditional therapies. Alternative modalities are used instead of traditional therapies. 2. Susan used biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, and imagery. 3. Patients should learn everything they can about a therapy before trying it.

Feverfew is used for migraine headaches. 2. Capsaicin is used for pain associated with a variety of disorders. 3. St. John’s wort is used for depression. 4. Several sources should be consulted before taking herbs. The internet has a lot of good information, but the source should be carefully evaluated. An excellent resource is www.nccih.nih.gov/health. A pharmacist knowledgeable in herbs and herb–drug interactions, as well as the health- care provider, should be consulted. Additionally, it is always wise to consult with your health- care practitioner before adding herbal therapies. 5. “Mrs. Lawless, I am concerned that these herbs could interact with your heart failure medications.
