Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that arises from the connective tissue in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is the most common form of [[Sarcoma]] found in the GI tract and can occur anywhere along it, though it most frequently develops in the stomach or small intestine.

### Key Points about GIST:
- **Origin**: GISTs arise from specialized cells in the GI tract known as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), which are part of the autonomic nervous system and help regulate the movement of food through the [[Digestive]] system.
  
- **Symptoms**: Symptoms can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor, but they may include abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, and feeling full quickly after [[Eating]]. Some GISTs are asymptomatic and found incidentally.

- **Diagnosis**: GISTs are typically diagnosed through imaging studies like CT scans or MRIs, followed by biopsy and histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry is often used to identify specific markers like KIT (CD117), which is present in most GISTs.

- **Treatment**: Treatment options depend on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Surgery is the primary treatment for localized GISTs. For tumors that are inoperable or metastatic, targeted therapy with [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like [[imatinib]] (Gleevec), which inhibits the KIT protein, is commonly used. Other treatment options include radiation and chemotherapy, though GISTs are generally less responsive to [[Traditional Chemotherapy]].

- **Prognosis**: The prognosis for GIST varies widely depending on factors such as tumor size, location, mitotic rate (how quickly the cancer cells are dividing), and whether the cancer has spread. Early detection and treatment improve the outlook significantly.
