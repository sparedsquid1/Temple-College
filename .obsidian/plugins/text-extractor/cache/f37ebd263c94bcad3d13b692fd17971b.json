COMPLICATIONS AND TREATMENT OF IDA Untreated IDA progresses to- Heart muscle becomes too weak to function Possible heart failure Growth retardation Cognitive changes Screening blood work recommended from 9 to 24 months of age and earlier for preterm and low birth weight babies Ferrous Sulfate Vitamin C Foods rich in iron Imferon 7 8 2/25/2025 5 SICKLE CELL DISEASE • Sickle cell trait (asymptomatic) • Blood of the patient contains a mixture of Hgb A and sickle (Hgb S). • Proportions of Hgb S are low because the disease is inherited from only one parent. • Hgb and RBC counts are normal. SICKLE CELL DISEASE • Sickle cell anemia (more severe) Clinical symptoms do not appear until the last part of the first year of life. May be an unusual swelling of the fingers and toes Symptoms caused by enlarging bone marrow sites that impair circulation to the bone and the abnormal sickle cell shape that causes clumping, obstruction in the vessel, and ischemia to the organ the vessel supplies 9 10 2/25/2025 6 MANIFESTATIONS Hgb level ranges 6 to 9 g/dL or lower. • Child is pale, tires easily, and has little appetite. Sickle cell crises are painful and can be fatal. • Symptoms: severe abdominal pain, muscle spasms, leg pain, or painful swollen joints may be seen • Fever, vomiting, hematuria, convulsions, stiff neck, coma, or paralysis can result. • Risk for stroke as a complication of a vaso-occlusive sickle cell crisis TYPES OF SICKLE CELL CRISIS Vaso-occlusive (painful crises) Splenic sequestration Aplastic crises Hyperhemolytic 11 12 2/25/2025 7 SICKLE CELL CRISIS TREATMENT Oxygen therapy Hydration Rest Protection from infection Pain control Blood transfusion Emotional support Bone marrow transplant Surgery THALASSEMIA Group of hereditary blood disorders- cannot produce sufficient amount of adult hemoglobin Blood cells- abnormal size and shape Blood cells- rapidly destroyed Chronic anemia Most common- Polypeptide chain beta- thalassemia 13 14 2/25/2025 8 THALASSEMIA MINOR Inherited gene from only one parent Mild anemia Pale, enlarged spleen Needs genetic counseling THALASSEMIA MAJOR Also called- Cooley’s anemia Both parents carrier More serious form of disease Progressive severe anemia within the 2nd 6 months of life Symptoms- Pale, hypoxia, poor appetite, fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, facial changes, protruding teeth Complications Cardiac failure Pathological fractures Diagnosis Family history Bone growth studies Blood tests Hemoglobin electrophoresis 15 16 2/25/2025 9 THALASSEMIA MAJOR (CONT.) • Poor • Death due to CHF, severe anemia, or infection Prognosis • Maintain hemoglobin levels • Provide for growth and development and normal physical activity • Prevention and early treatment for infections • Splenectomy • Bone marrow transplants • Iron-chelating agents • Emotional health of child and parents needs Treatment and Nursing care HEMOPHILIA Oldest hereditary disease More common in men Transmitted by females on the X chromosome Blood does not clot properly due to: • Two common forms • Hemophilia A- deficiency in factor VIII • Hemophilia B- deficiency in factor IX 17 18 2/25/2025 10 HEMOPHILIA (CONT.) Manifestations Abnormal bleeding Prolonged clotting time (Partial Thromboplastin Time PTT) Anemia Leukocytosis Moderate increase in platelets in the hemorrhaging child Hematuria Shock Death HEMOPHILIA (CONT.) Treatment and Nursing care Prevent bleeding- replacing the missing factor DDAVP Parent education Monitor puncture sites Check stool and urine- occult blood Avoid salicylates RICE Medic alert bracelet Carry factor replacement Transfusions 19 20 2/25/2025 11 IDIOPATHIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA ITP Acquired platelet disorder Affects the number of platelets or their function Autoimmune system reaction to a virus Manifestations • Bruises easy • Petechiae and purpura • Nosebleeds • Platelet count- below 20,000/mm3 • Hx of viral infection ITP TREATMENT AND NURSING CARE • Treatment and Nursing care • Neurologic assessment • Avoid drugs- interfere with platelet production (ASA, NSAIDS) • Limit activity • Observe for s/s of bleeding • Packed Red Blood Cell transfusion • Administration- prednisone and IV gamma globulin • Splenectomy • Immunizations 21 22 2/25/2025 12 LEUKEMIA Malignant disease of the blood forming organs Uncontrolled growth of immature WBC’s Blastocysts WBC’s 50,000 to 100,000/mm3 Cannot fight infection Anemia Bleeding Most common childhood cancer Most common Acute Lymphoid Leukemia(ALL) Acute Nonlymphoid (myelogenous) Leukemia(AMLL or AML) LEUKEMIA (CONT.) Manifestations Low grade fever Pallor Bruising Leg and
