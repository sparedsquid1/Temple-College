Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder characterized by a group of symptoms that indicate damage to the kidneys' filtering system, specifically the glomeruli. This damage leads to excessive protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), resulting in a variety of complications.

### Key Features of Nephrotic Syndrome:
- **Proteinuria:** The hallmark of nephrotic syndrome is significant protein loss in the urine, typically greater than 3.5 grams per day.
- **Hypoalbuminemia:** Due to the loss of protein in the urine, there is a low level of albumin (a type of protein) in the [[Blood]].
- **Edema:** Fluid retention occurs, leading to swelling, particularly in the legs, ankles, feet, and around the eyes.
- **[[hyperlipidemia]]:** The body compensates for the loss of proteins by increasing the production of lipids (fats), leading to elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the [[Blood]].
- **Hypercoagulability:** There is an increased risk of [[Blood]] clots due to changes in the levels of clotting factors.

### Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome:
- **Primary (Idiopathic) Causes:** These include conditions that primarily affect the kidneys, such as minimal change disease (most common in children), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy.
- **Secondary Causes:** Nephrotic syndrome can also result from systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, lupus ([[systemic lupus erythematosus]]), infections, certain medications, and cancers.

### Diagnosis:
- **Urine Tests:** A 24-hour urine collection is often used to measure protein loss. A simple urine dipstick test may also indicate proteinuria.
- **[[Blood]] Tests:** These are done to check albumin levels, kidney function (creatinine and [[Blood]] urea nitrogen), and lipid levels.
- **Kidney Biopsy:** In some cases, a kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome, especially if a secondary cause is suspected.

### Treatment:
- **Managing Symptoms:** Treatment often includes [[Diuretics]] to manage edema, ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria, and statins to control [[hyperlipidemia]].
- **Underlying Cause:** Addressing the underlying cause is crucial. For example, if nephrotic syndrome is secondary to diabetes, managing [[Blood]] sugar levels is important. Immunosuppressive therapies may be used for conditions like lupus or minimal change disease.
- **Dietary Changes:** A low-sodium diet may be recommended to help control edema, and in some cases, a diet low in protein might be advised to reduce the load on the kidneys.

### Prognosis:
The outlook for individuals with nephrotic syndrome depends on the underlying cause and the response to treatment. Some forms, especially in children, may respond well to treatment and go into remission, while others may lead to chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment as needed.
