**Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)** is a type of chronic inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints, where the spine meets the pelvis. It can lead to pain, stiffness, and eventually the fusion of the vertebrae, causing a loss of spinal flexibility.

### Key Features of Ankylosing Spondylitis:

1. **Spinal Pain and Stiffness:**
   - The most characteristic symptom is chronic pain and stiffness in the lower back and buttocks, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity.
   - The pain often improves with exercise but not with rest.

2. **Progressive Spinal Fusion:**
   - Over time, the inflammation can lead to the formation of new bone, causing sections of the spine to fuse together in a fixed, immobile position, a condition known as ankylosis.
   - This can result in a loss of normal spinal curvature and lead to a stooped posture.

3. **Peripheral Arthritis:**
   - While the spine is most commonly affected, AS can also involve other joints, such as the hips, shoulders, and, less commonly, the knees and ankles.

4. **Enthesitis:**
   - Inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, is common in AS. This can lead to pain and swelling, particularly in areas like the Achilles tendon, the bottom of the feet, or the ribs.

5. **Fatigue:**
   - Chronic inflammation and pain can lead to significant fatigue, which is a common symptom of AS.

6. **Extra-Articular Manifestations:**
   - **Eye Inflammation (Uveitis/Iritis):** A common complication, leading to redness, pain, and blurred [[Vision]].
   - **[[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]] (IBD):** Some people with AS also have conditions like Crohnâ€™s disease or ulcerative colitis.
   - **Cardiovascular Issues:** AS can increase the risk of [[Heart]] and vascular issues.
   - **Lung Involvement:** Reduced chest expansion due to spinal fusion can impact lung function.

### Causes and Risk Factors:

- **Genetics:** The exact cause of AS is not known, but genetics play a significant role. The HLA-B27 [[gene]] is strongly associated with the disease, although not everyone with this [[gene]] will develop AS.
- **Age and Gender:** AS typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and is more common in men than in women.

### Diagnosis:

- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:** Diagnosis is often based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and imaging studies.
- **Imaging:** X-rays and MRI can reveal characteristic changes in the sacroiliac joints and spine.
- **[[Blood]] Tests:** These may be used to detect inflammation and to check for the presence of the HLA-B27 [[gene]], although this test alone is not definitive.

### Treatment:

- **Medications:**
  - **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]]):** These are often the first line of treatment to reduce pain and inflammation.
  - **Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitors:** These biologic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] can be effective in controlling symptoms and slowing disease progression.
  - **Interleukin-17 (IL-17) Inhibitors:** Newer biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways.

- **Physical Therapy:** Exercise and physical therapy are crucial in maintaining spinal mobility, posture, and overall function.

- **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgery might be necessary to correct spinal deformities or replace damaged joints.

### Prognosis:

Ankylosing Spondylitis is a lifelong condition, but the severity and progression can vary widely. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve quality of life and prevent severe complications. Regular exercise, proper medication, and monitoring can help manage symptoms and maintain a good level of physical activity.
