Dyskinesia refers to abnormal, involuntary movements that can affect different parts of the body. These movements can be jerky, repetitive, and uncontrollable. Dyskinesia is often associated with long-term use of certain medications, particularly those used to treat Parkinson's disease (such as [[levodopa]]). There are different types of dyskinesia, including:

- **[[Tardive Dyskinesia]]:** Often caused by long-term use of antipsychotic medications, characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, especially of the face and [[Tongue]].
- **[[levodopa]]-Induced Dyskinesia:** A common side effect of long-term use of [[levodopa]] in Parkinson's disease treatment, causing involuntary movements.
- **Chorea:** Rapid, dance-like movements that can affect various body parts.

Treatment for dyskinesia may involve adjusting medications, trying alternative treatments, or using therapies like deep brain stimulation to manage symptoms.
