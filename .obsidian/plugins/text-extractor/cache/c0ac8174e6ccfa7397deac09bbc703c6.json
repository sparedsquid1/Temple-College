muscle tensions • 2) moderate: perceptual field diminishes or narrows; hard to attend surroundings, follow commands, and be vigilant; increased vitals; optimum state for problem solving • 3) severe: perceptual field is so diminished that concentration centers on one detail only or many extraneous details; unable to attend surroundings; physical symptoms; fight or flight response (muscle rigidity, decreased sensation, selective hearing, difficulty problem solving, time disassociation, threatening symptoms, overload; possible depression) • Panic mode: sheared tremor, only wants to escape, impossible to communicate, sympathetic nervous systems cause increased vitals, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dry mouth, dilated pupils, pain and hearing decrease, loss of control, no problem solving ▪ Treatment, psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, group therapy, systemic desensitization, hypnosis, mediation, biofeedback o Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): broad, long-lasting (6 months or longer), and excessive; worried/anxious often (with no obvious reason); hard controlling worry ▪ Effecting factors: money, family, health, work, school ▪ Symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, difficulty focusing, excessive anxiety/worry, sore and tense muscles, insomnia, impaired concentration, irritability, difficulty sleeping (must have 3 symptoms) ▪ Three stages: crisis, adaption, or exhaustion • Crisis: alarm stage; blood vessels constrict, norepinephrine and epinephrine are released, BP and HR increases; overall increased adrenaline • Adaptation (resistance): body returns to homeostasis, cortisol is released; this stage is the goal; body tries to repair itself • Exhaustion: immune system becomes challenged; potential death; results from prolonged/ chronic stress; physical, emotionally, and mentally drained; burnout, fatigue, and depression are possible o Stress: body’s response to challenges or demands that are unavoidable; each person views it differently based on their coping mechanisms ▪ Related conditions: immunity impairment, burnout, cancer, asthma ▪ Positive: rare (ex- weddings, helps avoid danger) • Positive stress is also known as “eustress” ▪ Negative: more commonly associated with stress o Panic Disorders: feeling of “losing control”; extreme fear with no real danger ▪ Symptoms: chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, tremors, feelings of suffocation, numbness/tingling, GI upset, diaphoresis ▪ Agoraphobia: fear of wide-open spaces o Phobic Disorders: irrational fear reaction; develops in childhood; obsessive in nature; vary with cultural views; intense distress which causes exaggeration ▪ 3 subtypes: specific, social, and agoraphobia ▪ **can lead to panic attack due to the fear they get from talking about them** ▪ Acrophobia: fear of heights ▪ Ailurophobia: fear of cats ▪ Carcinomatophobia: fear of cancer ▪ Decidophobia: fear of making decisions ▪ Nyctophobia: fear of darkness ▪ Odontophobia: fear of teeth or dental surgery ▪ Scoleciphobia: fear of worms ▪ Thanatophobia: fear of death o PTSD: anxiety & flashbacks triggered by traumatic events ▪ Can lead to anxiety, depression, survivor's guilt, and nightmares ▪ Flat affect, may blame themselves or others, loss of interest in daily life, isolation for coping, guarded, insomnia, low self-esteem, depression ▪ Usually self-medicate with alcohol or medications (drugs) ▪ Flashbacks are common (vivid recollections) and can be life threatening o Somatic Symptom Disorder: extreme focus on physical symptoms that leads to one not being able to function ▪ Very similar to the somatoform disorder (according to the DSM-IV) ▪ Derangement develops due to disruption of one’s daily life ▪ Pain, nausea, dizziness that science cannot prove ▪ To be diagnosed, they must have persistent symptoms of at least 6 months ▪ Types: • Functional neurological (conversion): cannot be explained by disease or condition; affects movement, talking, swallowing, hearing, and vision • Dysmorphobia/body dysmorphic: mental disorder that causes one to look at appearance differently than how others view them • Somatization disorder: mental disorder; complaints about somatic symptoms • Somatoform pain disorder o Depression: mental disturbance that is a type of painful and debilitating illness; one of the most common mood disorders in the U.S. (about 17% chance an individual will develop depression) ▪ Anyone can have depression, doesn’t matter age, ethnics, or socioeconomic status ▪ We have all experienced some sort of depression • The differentiating factor of depression is the severity and duration ▪ Affected by mood and affect (will change to reflect current situation) • Mood- can be positive or negative • Affect- outward manifestations ▪ Types: • Major depressive disorder: must have 5 or more symptoms in a 2-week period (sleep disturbances, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, weight gain or loss, decreased interest in pleasurable activities (anhedonia), decreased appetite/ability to think/concentrate, loss of interest in daily life, “life’s not worth living”, increased fatigue/agitation, low self- esteem, alters physical functions, may isolate themselves from society) o Chronic sadness, sense of despair, low mood, suicidal thoughts • Dysthymic Disorder (also known as “persistent depressive disorder”): chronic form of depression that lasts over 2 years and interferes with work and relationships; DYSPHORIA, not euphoria o DSM-5 was renamed in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association • Postpartum Depression (PPD): “blues” that are common in response to the body’s hormones after giving birth (as soon as 4 months after delivery); causes fatigue and anxiety and usually resolves in a short period of time o Can develop up to a year post-partum; may have same symptoms as major depressive disorder (lack of interest in baby, psychosis, rejection) • Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): occurs during colder months and subsides during spring and summer o Melatonin levels change due to the seasons which alters sleeping patterns and causes difficulty falling and staying asleep o Phototherapy allow an increase of exposure to natural light to maintain melatonin levels o Women are more likely to experience SAD • Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder: emotional disturbances related to a legal or illegal chemical o Drugs that may lead to depression: beta blockers, oral contraceptives, benzos, steroids, psychoactive agents, anabolic steroids, chemo, alcohol, amphetamines/cocaine withdrawal, opioids • Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: occurs the week prior to menses (period) and can interfere with work, school, social activities; added to DSM-5 in 2013 o Symptoms improve after menstruation begins o Depressed mood, excessive anxiety, mood swings (mental) o Tender breasts, headaches, joint/muscle pain, bloating, weight gain, change in appetite, extreme fatigue, hyper-insomnia or insomnia (physical) • Depression associated with other medical conditions at higher risk and greater priority o Such as: vascular brain disease such as strokes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, cancer, adrenal disorders, hypothyroidism, parkinson’s disease, diabetes, brain tumors, chronic pain, myocardial infarction, multiple sclerosis o Can cause extreme sadness and hopelessness • Causes of depression overall o Altered serotonin and/or norepinephrine o Genetics o Gender (men are less likely to admit they’re sad because of vulnerability) ▪ Twice as many women reports feeling depressed o Self-concept o Loss and grief • Treatment: antidepressants mainly o 1st line- psychotherapy o 2nd line- electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): use of electrical currents to cause seizures to overall help severe depressive disorders o 3rd line: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): non-evasive; used when other treatment doesn’t work o Bipolar Disorder: mood swings from profound depression to extreme euphoria with intervals of normalcy ▪ Two phases • Manic phase: last weeks or months • Depressive phase: last weeks or months (patient will seek help during this phase) ▪ Terms • Cyclothymic: chronic mood disturbances involving numerous episodes of hypomania and depressed mood with less intensity • Hypomania: mild form of mania • Mania: elevated, expansive, irritable mood; manic episode; burns off excessive energy ▪ Types of bipolar disorders • Bipolar I: full syndrome of manic symptoms and possible depressive episodes o Higher highs and lower lows; delusions are common • Bipolar II: recurrent bouts of major depression with episodes of hypomania; may have never truly experienced full episode of mania o Marked by 1-2 weeks of lethargy and withdrawal o Death from exhaustion is likely • Cyclothymic: chronic mood disturbance of at least 2 years; numerous episodes of hypomania and mild depressed mood (less intensity) ▪ Causes • Altered levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine o Increased with manic episodes o Decreased in depressive ones • Genetics (twin study), family, biochemical, brain o Greatest risk is with 1st degree relatives who have bipolar disorder • Medications and medical conditions can be triggers for those who are more susceptible to bipolar disorders ▪ Need to know facts • After first episode, there is a high risk of reoccurrence • Gender doesn’t matter • May or may not be associated with depression • Diagnosed between ages 15-24 o Can be confused with ADHD in younger children ▪ Symptoms • Manic phase symptoms can last from days to months and cause marked disruption of occupation and social functioning, as well as psychotic features o Elevated mood (euphoric), excess activity (hyperactivity), increased energy, racing thought, excessive talking, high self- esteem, easily distracted, little need for sleep, poor temper control, irritable and impulsive o Reckless behavior: drinking, drug use, poor judgement, promiscuity, brief period of extravagant spending • Depressed phase symptoms are like those of major depressive disorders o Decreased mood (dysphoric), sad, hopeless, despair, fatigue, decreased appetite, suicidal, insomnia, decreased interest, uneasiness ▪ Treatment • Mood stabilizers • Antipsychotics • ECT • Psychotherapy- helps with compliance and support ❖ Describe the drug classification, uses, interactions, adverse reactions, contraindications, & precautions of the following medications used to treat anxiety & mood disorders o Anxiety medication: remember that meds can cause drowsiness, so educate about using no machinery or driving ▪ Antidepressants • SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors): may take weeks to see improvement (ex: zolac & prozac) ▪ Antianxiety (benzos) ▪ Antihistamines (best med; non-addicting & quick relief; hydroxyzine) ▪ Sedatives o Depression medication ▪ Antidepressants: increases serotonin in brain synapses; may take several weeks to show effects • MAOIs : educate about no tyramine foods (aged cheeses, red wines, smoked and processed meats) as it could lead to a hypertensive crisis o Ex: tranylcypromine (Parnate) • If one’s behavior starts getting better (ex: they start making themself look presentable), then that means the medication is working o Bipolar disorder medication ▪ Mood stabilizers: Lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics (atypical) • Will take for many years (lifetime medication) • Start with low dose and then you can increase • Side effects: drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, GI upset, tremors, polyuria, dehydration, weight gain, increased suicide risk • Lithium therapeutic level: 0.5-1.2 milliequivalents per liter o 1.0-1.5 in acute mania is normal o Can become elevated if dehydrated, profuse sweating, chronic diarrhea (leads to toxicity) o Toxicity can cause find hand tremors, nausea, confusion, seizures, coma, and possible death o Early warning signs: nausea, vomiting, sedation • Common anticonvulsants: valproic acid (Depakene), gabapentin (Neurontin), and Carbamazepine (Tegretol) ❖ Utilize therapeutic communication to assist individuals with anxiety, anxiety-related, and somatic symptom disorders, depressive & bipolar disorders o Anxiety nursing interventions ▪ Educate about prevention (most effective way to cope) ▪ Therapeutic and open communication ▪ Calm environment ▪ Observe for suicidal ideation ▪ Document all changes ▪ Biofeedback therapy o Panic Disorder interventions ▪ Education ▪ Short, simple sentences ▪ Block attacks with drugs ▪ Assist and help client develop adaptive ways to cope o PSTD interventions ▪ Reorient ▪ Safety is key o Somatic symptom disorder interventions ▪ Communication ▪ Attitude of acceptance and understanding ▪ Use client’s level of anxiety as a gage for help ▪ Educate on stress management ▪ Light exercise and relaxation o Depression interventions ▪ Patience is key (sit and be still with them) ▪ Promote honesty and therapeutic communication (active listening and offer help) • Important to have them elaborate (“tell me more”) ▪ Consistency ▪ Encourage healthy nutrition and activity ▪ Promote self-esteem ▪ Establish small achieve goals o Bipolar interventions ▪ Mania: worry about safety because of irrational behavior and possible reckless actions • Tell them behavior isn’t appropriate, escort them back to room • Aerobic exercise • Always do whatever to protect patient from self-inflicted harm ▪ Monitor lithium levels ▪ Consistency ▪ Healthy nutrition and adequate exercise ▪ Provide clear, firm limits ▪ Patient safety is key ❖ Understand nursing care for individuals who are suicidal o Suicide: act that intentionally takes one's own life; can be voluntarily or involuntarily; self-inflicted ▪ Civil rights, ethical issue ▪ 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. & 2nd leading cause of death within adults (ages 45-64) ▪ Always assess anyone who has suicidal ideation o Causes ▪ Depressive disorder & substance abuse (greatest risk factor) ▪ Suicide “pacts” (between teenagers) o Contributors: shame, guilt, isolation o Methods ▪ Most common is firearms, hanging and overdoses ▪ Men- usually with help of firearms or hanging (more severe) ▪ Women- usually by overdose o Warning signs (watch so that you can assess) ▪ Verbal threats (will want to be left alone) ▪ Prior attempts (or if they have a method/plan) ▪ Access to lethal methods ▪ Risk taking behavior ▪ Pocketing pills ▪ Giving personal items away o Treatment ▪ Suicide contracts (promise to not attempt until support is contacted) ▪ Watch for all hints (they are usually undecisive so it’s important to intervene) o Interventions ▪ Take all threats seriously ▪ Honest and confrontational communication • “Are you planning to kill yourself?” • “How?” • “When?” ▪ Stay on phone if you’re not with them ▪ Maintain safety ▪ Close monitoring (move close to nurse station, notify staff of suicide risk) ▪ Remove all potential weapons (knives, silverware, pens, glass bottles, bed linens, electrical cords ▪ Make sure they’re not pocketing their medications (they could be waiting to take them all at once and cause an overdose) o Important to help surviving family and friends connect with support groups for such a devastating loss!!!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
