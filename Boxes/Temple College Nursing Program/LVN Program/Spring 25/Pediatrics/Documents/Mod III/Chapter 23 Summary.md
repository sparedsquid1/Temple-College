## **1. The Ear and Hearing Conditions**

### **Anatomy of the Ear in Newborns**

- **Tympanic membrane**: More horizontal, vascular, and has an inconsistent light reflex.
- **Eustachian tube**: Shorter and straighter than in adults, increasing the risk for infections.
- **Functions of the Eustachian tube**: Ventilation, protection, drainage.

### **Otitis Externa (Swimmer’s Ear)**

- **Definition**: Infection of the external ear canal.
- **Signs/Symptoms**: Pain when moving the pinna or tragus, normal tympanic membrane.
- **Causes**: Often occurs after swimming, possible links to diabetes or herpes zoster.
- **Treatment**: Irrigation, topical antibiotics, or antivirals.

### **Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection)**

- **Common after upper respiratory infections (URIs)**.
- **Risk factors**:
    - Short, wide, straight Eustachian tubes.
    - Immature immune system.
    - Large adenoids.
    - Secondhand smoke exposure.
    - Lying down with a bottle.
    - Attending group childcare.
- **Surgical Management**:
    - **Myringotomy**: Small incision to drain fluid.
    - **Pressure Equalization (PE) Tubes**: Help prevent infections, fall out within 6-12 months.

### **Hearing Impairment**

- **Causes**:
    - Sound transmission defects.
    - Auditory nerve damage.
    - Mixed impairments (both structural and nerve damage).
- **Signs and Symptoms**:
    - **Infants**: Lack of startle reflex, no response to noise, delayed vocalization.
    - **Older children**: Monotone speech, loud speaking, need for repetition.
- **Effects**: Delayed speech/language, social/emotional issues, academic struggles.
- **Interventions**: Face child, speak clearly, use sign language, speech therapy, special education.

- A. Monitor urine output
- B. Keep the child in a well-lit room
- C. Implement droplet precautions ✅
- D. Encourage the child to play with peers

**Rationale:** Bacterial meningitis is **highly contagious**, and **droplet precautions** help prevent the spread.

---

- A. "Your child should avoid touching their eyes and wash hands frequently." ✅
- B. "You should give your other children antibiotics as a precaution."
- C. "Cover your child's eye with a patch to contain the infection."
- D. "Allow your children to share towels but wash them often."

**Rationale:** **Handwashing** and **avoiding eye touching** are the **best** ways to prevent spreading **conjunctivitis**.

---

### **9. A child with suspected retinoblastoma has a yellow-white glow in the pupil. What is the next step?**

- A. Schedule an eye exam ✅
- B. Administer antibiotic eye drops
- C. Monitor the child’s vision at home
- D. Prescribe glasses

**Rationale:** A **yellow-white glow in the pupil (cat's eye reflex)** is a hallmark sign of **retinoblastoma**, requiring **immediate evaluation**.

---

### **10. A child is diagnosed with hyphema. What is the best nursing intervention?**

- A. Keep the child flat in bed
- B. Elevate the head of the bed 30-45 degrees ✅
- C. Allow the child to participate in active play
- D. Encourage frequent movement of the affected eye

- A. "Insert cotton swabs into the ear to remove drainage."
- B. "Keep ears dry while swimming or bathing." ✅
- C. "This condition is caused by allergies."

- A. Patching the weaker eye
- B. Patching the stronger eye ✅
- C. Applying warm compresses
- D. Administering antibiotic drops

**Rationale:** **Patching the stronger eye** forces the weaker eye to work harder, improving **strabismus**.

---

- A. Document seizure activity
- B. Maintain an open airway ✅
- C. Turn the child onto their back

- A. Eliminates sugar, which causes seizures
- B. Provides high fat and low carbohydrates to reduce seizures ✅
- C. Helps build muscle to prevent convulsions
- D. Increases protein for better brain function

**Rationale:** The **ketogenic diet** is high in **fat** and **low in carbohydrates**, which helps **control seizures** in drug-resistant epilepsy.

---

### **15. Which symptom in a child with encephalitis requires immediate intervention?**

- A. Low-grade fever
- B. Mild headache
- C. Seizures and decreased level of consciousness ✅
- D. Muscle twitching
