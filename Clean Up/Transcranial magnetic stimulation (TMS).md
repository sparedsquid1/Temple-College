Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique used to modulate brain activity. It involves the use of a magnetic field generated by a coil placed near the scalp to induce electrical currents in the brain. These currents can either increase or decrease the activity of specific brain regions, depending on the frequency and strength of the magnetic pulses. TMS is primarily used to treat various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as [[Depression]], obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraines. It is generally considered safe and well-tolerated, with common side effects including mild headaches and scalp discomfort. TMS is often used when other treatments, such as medication or psychotherapy, have not been effective.
