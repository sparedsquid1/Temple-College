## **Chapter 21: Cardiovascular System Function and Therapeutic Measures**

### **1. Overview of the Cardiovascular System**

- The cardiovascular system consists of the **heart, blood vessels, and blood**, which work together to transport oxygen, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body.
- It plays a crucial role in **maintaining homeostasis**, regulating temperature, and removing waste products.

#### **Key Components:**

1. **Heart** – Acts as a pump with four chambers (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle).
2. **Blood Vessels** – Arteries, veins, and capillaries that distribute blood.
3. **Blood** – Carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste; composed of red and white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.

### **2. Cardiac Physiology and Blood Circulation**

- **Pulmonary circulation**: Moves blood between the heart and lungs.
- **Systemic circulation**: Delivers oxygenated blood to the body.
- **Coronary circulation**: Provides oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle itself.

#### **Heart Function:**

- **Electrical conduction system**: Includes the **SA node (pacemaker), AV node, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers**.
- **Cardiac cycle**: Alternates between **systole (contraction)** and **diastole (relaxation)**.
- **Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO)**: Measure the amount of blood pumped by the heart.

- **Symptoms**: Chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue.
- **Treatment**:
    - Medications (statins, aspirin, beta-blockers).
    - Lifestyle changes (healthy diet, exercise).
    - Surgical options (**angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting—CABG**).

#### **C. Heart Failure**

- **Definition**: The heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs.
- **Causes**: CAD, hypertension, valve disorders, past heart attacks.
- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, fluid retention, shortness of breath, swelling in legs.
- **Treatment**:
    - Medications (**diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers**).

---

### **2. Cardiac Output & Circulation**

2. A patient’s **cardiac output (CO)** is decreased due to **low stroke volume (SV)**. What factor can increase **stroke volume**?
    
    - A. Increased preload ✅
    - B. Increased afterload
    - C. Decreased contractility
    - D. Increased heart rate  
        **Rationale:** Increased **preload** (volume returning to the heart) enhances **stroke volume**, improving **cardiac output**.
