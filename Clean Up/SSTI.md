SSTI stands for **Skin and Soft Tissue Infections**. These infections involve the skin, underlying tissue, fat, and sometimes muscles, and can range from mild to severe. SSTIs are commonly caused by bacteria, with the most frequent pathogens being *Staphylococcus aureus* (including [[MRSA]]) and *Streptococcus pyogenes*. They can result from cuts, scrapes, or insect bites, but in some cases, they occur without a clear source of injury.

### Common Types of SSTIs:
1. **Cellulitis**: A bacterial infection of the deeper layers of the skin, leading to redness, swelling, warmth, and pain.
2. **Abscess**: A collection of pus under the skin, often painful and swollen, which may require drainage.
3. **Impetigo**: A highly contagious infection, more common in children, characterized by red sores or blisters that can break open and ooze.
4. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**: A rare but severe and life-threatening infection that affects the deeper layers of skin and tissue and spreads quickly.

### Risk Factors:
- Cuts or wounds in the skin
- Immunosuppression (e.g., diabetes, cancer)
- Poor hygiene or living conditions
- Chronic diseases
- Obesity

### Treatment:
- **Antibiotics**: Oral or intravenous antibiotics depending on the severity of the infection.
- **Drainage**: For abscesses, surgical drainage may be necessary to remove pus.
- **Debridement**: In more serious cases, especially with necrotizing infections, surgical removal of dead tissue may be required.
- **Supportive Care**: This can include pain management, wound care, and fluid support.

Prevention involves proper wound care, good hygiene, and in some cases, prophylactic antibiotics, especially in individuals at higher risk.
