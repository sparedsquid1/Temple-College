A 6-year-old client is presenting with signs and symptoms of fever, cough, stuffy nose, general malaise, and muscle aches. The nurse prepares to administer which medication to this client? A) Aspirin B) Magnesium salicylate C) Acetaminophen D) Diflunisal Answer: C Rationale: The known actions of acetaminophen include treating mild to moderate pain and reducing fever. Children and teenagers with influenza or chickenpox should not take salicylates, particularly aspirin, because of the association of developing Reye syndrome. Magnesium salicylate and diflunisal are also salicylates.

Which points should a nurse include in the teaching plan for a client who has been prescribed a nonopioid analgesic? A) Discontinue the dosage of the drug immediately if symptoms disappear. B) Take any over-the-counter (OTC) drug if pain increases. C) Contact the health care provider if temperature remains high even after 3 days. D) Discard the medication if a vinegar odor is detected. Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to dispose of the medication if there is a vinegar smell. This is a sign that the salicylate has deteriorated and is not safe to be taken. No OTC drugs should be taken without first consulting the primary health care provider. If the drug is used to reduce fever, contact the primary health care provider if the temperature continues to remain elevated for more than 1 day, not 3 days.

A client receiving magnesium salicylate is reporting gastric upset to the nurse. Which intervention should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Administer the drug with orange juice. B) Include fiber-rich food in the client's diet. C) Administer antacids to minimize GI distress. D) Ensure drug is given at least 3 hours before meals. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse may administer antacids to minimize GI distress. Instead of orange juice, the nurse may administer the drug with milk to alleviate gastric upset. The nurse can also administer the drug with food to relieve gastric upset instead of giving the drug 3 hours before a meal. Including fiber-rich food in the client's diet will not significantly relieve gastric upset.

A group of nursing students are discussing the actions of aspirin. The students are able to correctly explain which action as being responsible for reducing fever? A) Inhibition of prostaglandins B) Dilation of peripheral blood vessels C) Inhibition of platelet aggregation D) Reduction in endorphins Answer: B Rationale: Salicylates lower body temperature by dilating peripheral blood vessels. The blood flows out to the extremities, resulting in the dissipation of the heat of fever, which in turn cools the body. Prostaglandin inhibition occurs with pain relief and is responsible for the drug's anti-inflammatory effects. Inhibition of platelet aggregation results in prolonged bleeding times and increases the risk of bleeding.

A nurse is assessing the medication history for a client who is to receive salicylate therapy. Which disorder if noted by the nurse would lead the nurse to closely monitor the client for salicylism? A) Antacids B) Anticoagulants C) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors D) Activated charcoal Answer: C Rationale: The use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, used to lower intraocular pressure, along with salicylates places the client at increased risk for salicylism. Combined use of anticoagulants and salicylates increases the client's risk for bleeding. Combined use of antacids with salicylates decreases the absorption of the salicylates. Combined use of activated charcoal with salicylates causes a decrease in the effects of salicylates.
