What is the advantage...and disadvantage to IV therapy? Direct access to bloodstream and effects are immediate Question How to master IV Fluid Solutions (hyper vs hypo tonic and osmotic pressures) • https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=axSo48ROnLg Types of IV Solutions- Isotonic \"The Lane Driver\" • Same concentration (osmolality) as blood • Fluid does not cause Cells to change in size • Use: • Expand the fluid volume of the body • Examples: • 0.9% normal saline (NS) • 5% dextrose in water (D5W) • Ringer's Lactate(LR) NS D5W LR Types of IV Solutions- Hypotonic \"The Wanderer\" • Different concentration (osmolality) as blood • Contains LESS solute than extravascular fluid • Desires to go \"wander\" to find cells to move its fluid into • Cells Do change in size • Fluid moves INTO cells...and swells • Danger to children! • Use • Cellular dehydration • Example • 0.45% normal saline (1/2 NS) ½ NS Types of IV Solutions-Hypertonic \"The Drainer\" • Different concentration (osmolality) as blood • Contains GREATER solute than blood • Cells do change in size • Desires to \"drain\" cells of their fluid... causing them to shrink • Use Replaces electrolytes Reduces edema • Examples: • 10% dextrose in water • 5% dextrose in 0.9% saline • 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline • 5% dextrose in Ringer’s lactate D10W D5 in 0.9NS D5 in .45 NS D5LR What is the difference between an isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solution? Question What is the difference between an isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solution? Isotonic: • Cells do not change in size; Use: Expand the fluid volume of the body • Examples: • 0.9% normal saline (NS) • 5% dextrose in water (D5W) • Ringer's Lactate(LR) Hypotonic: • Desires to go \"wander\" OUTSIDE of the vein to find cells to move its fluid into; Cells Do change in size • Fluid moves FROM veins & INTO cells...and swells • Danger to children! • Use:Cellular dehydration. • Example: 0.45% saline (1/2 NS) Hypertonic • Greater concentration (osmolality) than blood; Cells do change in size-Fluid moves OUT of cells and cells shrink • Use: Replaces electrolytes, Reduces edema • Examples: • 10% dextrose in water • 5% dextrose in 0.9% saline • 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline • 5% dextrose in Ringer’s lactate Question Intravenous solution containers Must be sterile Check expiration dates Check for clarity IV Bags • Show calibrations • Plastic cover on tubing port (pull off) • Plastic cover or foil tab over port used for additives • Top of bag-hanger for IV pole IV Bottles • Show Calibrations • Flat metal or plastic cover on top of bottle • Pull off cover • Exposed rubber stopper • Insert in to IV Tubing Administration Sets Primary IV set • Solution, tubing, needleless connector, IV stand Secondary/piggyback IV set • Medications given IV & added to existing IV line Parallel IV set • Y-type administration set-infuse blood products Controlled volume set • Controls volume for safety IV Tubing • Label IV tubing • Change set every • 96 hours • Reduce infection • Always assess and follow prescribed IV flow rates of infusion! Primary IV Set • IV tubing set includes: • A spike end • Drip chamber • The tubing • Flow regulator/clamp • Leur-lok connector • Injection ports IV Tubing Sizes Regular drops (10-20 gtt/mL); most common for adults Macrodrops (10-15gtt/mL) for viscous (thick) or sticky fluids (ie: blood) Microdrops (60 gtt/mL) for small amts of fluid or when exact amts need to be given • Pediatrics • Fragile veins Setting up IV infusion • https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=sy0pxCYw9nc Secondary/Piggyback Tubing • To hang IV antibiotics, antineoplastics (chemotherapy) • Placed higher than primary line-uses gravity • Once piggyback is completed primary IV begins • Always use needleless system! • Make sure clamps are open • Side and roller • Both on primary and secondary • Assess for • Adverse or side effects from medications • Drug incompatibility with primary IV solution • Signs-white precipitates in tubing • Very dangerous! • Always \"scrub the hub\" • Scrub the hub of ports with sterile alcohol swab prior to inserting How to Hang an IV Piggyback (nursing skills) • https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=1xGikqXhuyU Parallel or Y-Tubing • MUST be used to administer blood • Consent MUST be signed by the patient • Always have BOTH blood and 0.9 NS • Start the saline to keep IV access open, for emergency drugs • 0.9 NS is clamped once blood is started • Once blood is done, tubing is flushed with 0.9 NS • Blood products are never infused into same IV line as medications or other fluids! • Use large IV catheter needle to ensure cells are not damaged • Caring for client receiving blood: • Watch for adverse reactions • Vital signs • Chest pain • Shortness of breath • Itching • Back pain • If reaction... STOP INFUSION! Flushing Blood Tubing and Hanging Blood Products https://www.youtube .com/watch?v=7YjFf7 lXIn8 Controlled Volume Set • Uses • Controls volume of diluted medications • Backup safety method-prevents free flow of fluid to client • Small amount of fluid to be infused over a long period of time • Can use for risk of fluid overload: • Pediatric patients • Older adults • Burette • Tube-like chamber • Holds 150 ml fluid • Roller clamp regulates flow Burette Intermittent Intravenous Catheter (Saline or PRN lock) • Use for: • Intermittent IV access • Antibiotics • Heparin • Corticosteroids • Apply Luer-lock cap or an extension set to the IV cannula • Nursing Action: • Check the Lock for patency BEFORE and AFTER administering medications • Since no infusion-site may form blood clot • Reduce risk-order to flush- • Saline • Diluted heparin • Danger! Do not use full strength or concentrated dose heparin! Can cause death! Luer-lock IV Filters • Traps small particles-precipitated from solution • Prevent particles from entering vein • 0.22 micron filter-most common • 1.2 micron filter-for solution containing lipids or albumin • Special filters are used for blood components Filter Filter IV fluid: What should you look for on IV bag for safety?

AFTER and ONLY with approval by instructor BEFORE and with either instructor OR staff nurse present: • Remove peripheral IV site • Assist in the changing of peripheral IV dressings in the presence of either the instructor or the staff nurse • ONLY peripheral lines are considered • Student CAN do what....Hang IVPB antibiotic with instructor present AND facility approves! Question IV Catheter Sizes • 24 Gauge-small • 18 Gauge-large Higher the number-smaller the diameter Use judgement to determine gauge needed Never puncture the skin more than once with the same IV cannula • Blood administration-not to damage cells • Trauma-need rapid infusion Large (18) Gauge: • Fragile veins-Geriatric • Small veins-Pediatrics Small (24) Gauge: Venous Access Devices • Winged-tip or butterfly needle • Meant for short-term therapy • Supplied in odd-numbered gauges (17, 19, 23, and 25) • Pediatric & older population • Over-the-needle catheters • Consist of a needle with a catheter sheath over it • The needle is removed, leaving the flexible catheter in the vein • 18, 20, 22, 24, 26... gauge needles • Blood administration requires at least 18 g • IVF solutions: 20, 22 gauge • Fragile veins: 24 gauge • Through-the-needle catheter • Used for midline catheter insertion for long- term peripheral use –Central lines, PICC lines Winged-tip Through- the-needle Over-the- needle TC IV Therapy Policy The Temple College Vocational Nursing students will observe the following policy for managing patients with IV therapy in progress while under students’ care. 1. The instructor must supervise students when starting an IV and managing any aspect of IV therapy on their assigned patients. 2. Students must be approved by the instructor prior to being able to remove a peripheral IV site. 3. Students may perform or assist in the changing of peripheral IV dressings in the presence of either the instructor or the staff nurse. TC IV Therapy Policy 4. IV therapy will be limited to peripheral sites only, including tubing, dressing changes, and venipunctures. 5. Medication administration will be limited to plain IV solutions, pre-mixed IV piggyback solutions, and IV piggyback antibiotics. 6. Students may regulate peripheral IV infusions. 7. Students may maintain saline locks from previously inserted venipuncture devices, including flushing of site. TC IV Therapy Policy 8. IV push medications will not be administered. 9. Each health care facility’s policy for administering IV medications and managing IV therapy will be observed by the student and instructor. Students and instructors are responsible for knowledge of the particular facility policy. 10. Regarding PICCs and Central lines: IVPBs can be hung by a student with instructor supervision if this is considered within the LVN scope of practice at a specific facility. AGAIN-Students MUST have nursing instructor supervision when performing a venapuncture or IV therapy. IV Insertion https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=Awq362Xd6jc Peripheral IV Sites Consider: freedom of movement, vein size, contraindications, trauma, client preference Start distal...then proximal! Antecubital veins-restrains movement Feet veins- rarely used for adults, often require order Scalp veins-used for infants Skill Practice Log It's Your turn...
