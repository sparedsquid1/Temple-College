Four Stages of Cognitive Development Sensorimotor Stage – Birth to 2 years Child uses existing reflexes. Preoperational Stage – 2-7 years Child uses words and symbols. Concrete-operational Stage – 7-12 years Child shows the beginnings of the capacity for adult logic. Formal-operational Stage – 12 years and older Children show logical thought and the ability to hypothesize. Lev Vygotsky, 1896-1934  Sociocultural approach to development.  Children develop their abilities through social interactions with others.  Children develop in the shared knowledge of the culture.  Children learn through shared problem solving experiences with someone else, such as parents, teacher, siblings or a peer.  Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) – refers to the gap between what a given child can achieve alone, their potential development as determined by independent problem solving, and what they can achieve through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.  Scaffolding – temporary support that help the child learn to function independently. Lawrence Kholberg, 1927 – 1987  Kholberg studied how children develop in making judgments of right or wrong.  Kholberg used moral dilemmas to develop a stage theory of moral development.  Children progress at different rates.  Not all children or adults reach the highest level/stage. PSYC 2301 Handout for Chapter 9 Voyage through the Lifespan 2 Kholberg’s Stages of Moral Development Preconventional Morality Obeying rules to avoid punishment. Conventional Morality Emphasis on conformity and social approval. Postconventional Morality Rule of law are important for maintaining social order. Erik Erikson, 1902 – 1994  Developed eight stages of psychosocial development.  Emphasized social relationships in children’s development.  Development is bi-directional, parents influence children’s development and children influence their parent’s development.  Developmental tasks in each stage. Eight Stages of Psychosocial Development Birth -1 year Trust vs. Mistrust 1-3 years Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt 4-5 years Initiative vs. Guilt 6-12 years Industry vs. Inferiority Adolescence Identity vs. Role Diffusion (or Confusion) Young Adulthood Intimacy vs. Isolation Middle Adulthood Generativity vs. Stagnation Late Adulthood Integrity vs. Despair PSYC 2301 Handout for Chapter 9 Voyage through the Lifespan 3 Attachment Theory Attachment – an enduring emotional tie. John Bowlby, 1907 – 1990  Believed that health, mental health, and behavioral problems could be linked to early childhood.  Bowlby believed that children come into the world biologically pre-programmed to form attachments with others because this helps them survive.  The attachment figure, the child’s primary caregiver, acts as a secure base for exploring the world.  The attachment relationship acts as a prototype for all future social relationships  A child should receive the continuous care of the most important attachment figure for the first two and a half years of life.  Bowlby believed that the long term consequences of maternal deprivation could lead to delinquency, reduced intelligence, increased aggression, depression, or affectionless psychopathy. Mary Ainsworth, 1913 – 1999  Attachment keeps us together.  Developed the Strange Situation Experiment.  Identified three major types of attachment: o Secure attachment o Avoidant attachment (insecure) o Ambivalent/Resistant attachment (insecure) Harry Harlow, 1905 – 1981  Contact comfort – we have a primary drive to seek physical comfort through physical contact with one another.  Harlow and his colleagues conducted controversial experiments with rhesus monkeys.  Harlow published his research on the effects of partial and total social isolation. Konrad Lorenz, 1903 – 1989  Imprinting – the process occurring during a critical period in development. Lorenz studied the process that some birds bond with the first moving object that they see.  Lorenz studied instinctive behaviors in animals. He is recognized as one of the founding fathers of the study of animal behavior, ethology.  Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1973.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
