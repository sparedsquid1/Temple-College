A drug may have three different names: Chemical name—a scientific term that describes the molecular structure of a drug; it typically is the chemical component of the drug. Generic name—considered the official name of a drug and is the name given to a drug that can be made or marketed by any company; it is nonproprietary, meaning it is not owned by any specific agency. Trade name—selected by a specific company producing the drug for marketing purposes. When a drug name is followed by a trademark symbol ™ or a registered trademark symbol ®, this signifies that it is the trade or brand name. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=496) ^ref-1010

Antifungal drugs are contraindicated in clients with a history of allergy to the drug. Most of the systemic antifungal medications are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and are used only when the situation is life-threatening and outweighs the risk to the fetus. Griseofulvin is not recommended for those with severe liver disease. Voriconazole is contraindicated when clients are taking the following medications: terfenadine, astemizole, sirolimus, rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, ritonavir, ergot alkaloids, or long-acting barbiturates. Both voriconazole and itraconazole are contraindicated in clients taking cisapride, pimozide, or quinidine.

Abdominal pain and cramps, diarrhea Adverse reactions associated with the anthelmintic drugs, if they do occur, are usually mild when the drug is used in the recommended dosage. Rash is a serious adverse reaction to pyrantel, which is sold over the counter (OTC), without a prescription. As such, clients may begin self-treatment before notifying their primary health provider. Therefore, it is important to ask the client about skin reactions when use of this medication is disclosed to the provider.

Antiprotozoal drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity. Many of the drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy (most are pregnancy category C; except metronidazole, nitazoxanide, pregnancy category B; doxycycline, pregnancy category D; miltefosine, quinine, pregnancy category X). Quinine should not be prescribed for clients with myasthenia gravis, because it may cause respiratory distress and dysphagia. In addition, its use for leg cramps is discouraged because of the hematologic reactions that may occur. Antiprotozoal drugs should be used cautiously in children, lactating clients, and those who have hepatic or renal disease or bone marrow depression. Pregnancy category B antiprotozoals should be used cautiously in clients during pregnancy and lactation (can be given during the second and third trimesters) and in clients with blood dyscrasias, seizure disorders, severe hepatic impairment (metronidazole), bowel disease (paromomycin use interferes with absorption causing ototoxicity and renal impairment), or history of alcohol dependency. Clients with a history of mental health issues should not be prescribed mefloquine. — location: [6683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=6683) ^ref-50607

Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal (GI) system reactions include: Gastric upset, heartburn, nausea, vomiting Anorexia GI bleeding Although salicylates are relatively safe when taken as recommended on the label or by the primary health care provider, their use can occasionally result in more serious reactions. Loss of blood through the GI tract may occur with salicylate use. The amount of blood lost is insignificant when a single dose is taken. However, use of these drugs over a long period, even in normal doses, can result in significant blood loss. Some individuals are allergic to aspirin and other salicylates. Allergy to salicylates may be manifested by hives, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm with asthma-like symptoms, and anaphylactoid (allergic) reactions. — location: [7200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7200) ^ref-7598

Salicylates Adverse

---
Salicylates are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because salicylates prolong bleeding time, they are contraindicated in those with bleeding disorders or tendencies. These include clients with GI bleeding (from any cause), clients with blood dyscrasias (abnormalities), and clients receiving anticoagulant or antineoplastic drugs. Salicylates are classified as pregnancy category D (aspirin) and C drugs and should be used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [7208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7208) ^ref-50965

Salicylates Contra

---
Pediatric Children or teenagers with influenza or chickenpox should not take salicylates, particularly aspirin, because their use appears to be associated with Reye syndrome (a life-threatening condition characterized by vomiting and lethargy progressing to coma). Acetaminophen is recommended for managing symptoms associated with these disorders. — location: [7213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7213) ^ref-35796

---
Adverse reactions to acetaminophen are rare when the drug is used as directed. Adverse reactions associated with acetaminophen usually occur with chronic use or when the recommended dosage is exceeded. They include the following: Skin eruptions, urticaria (hives) Hemolytic anemia Pancytopenia (a reduction in all cellular components of the blood) Hypoglycemia Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin), hepatotoxicity (damage to the liver), and hepatic failure Acute acetaminophen poisoning or toxicity can occur after a single 10- to 15-g dose of acetaminophen. Doses of 20–25 g may be fatal. With excessive doses, the liver cells undergo necrosis (die), and death can result from liver failure. The risk of liver failure increases in clients who drink alcohol habitually. Signs of acute acetaminophen toxicity include nausea, vomiting, confusion, liver tenderness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, jaundice, and acute hepatic and renal failure. — location: [7267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7267) ^ref-5963

NonSalicylates contra

---
habitual alcohol users after therapeutic dosages. The individual taking acetaminophen should avoid alcohol if taking more than an occasional dose of acetaminophen and avoid taking acetaminophen concurrently with the salicylates or the NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is classified as a pregnancy category B drug and is used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. If an analgesic is necessary, it appears safe for short-term use. The drug is used cautiously in clients with severe or recurrent pain or high or continued fever because this may indicate a serious untreated illness. If pain persists for more than 5 days or if redness or swelling is present, the primary health care provider should be consulted. — location: [7279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7279) ^ref-52727

NSAIDs Adverse 2

---
The NSAIDs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity. There is a cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, meaning if a client is allergic to one NSAID, there is an increased risk of an allergic reaction with any other NSAID. Hypersensitivity to aspirin is a contraindication for all NSAIDs. In general, NSAIDs are contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy and during lactation. Also, they are not to be used for postoperative pain following CABG surgery. Some NSAIDs are not used to treat rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis; these include ketorolac, mefenamic, and meloxicam. Celecoxib is contraindicated in clients who are allergic to sulfonamides or have a history of cardiac disease or stroke. Ibuprofen is contraindicated in those who have hypertension, peptic ulceration, or GI bleeding. Arthrotec combines diclofenac and misoprostol (abortifacient), and should not be taken by pregnant women. — location: [7728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7728) ^ref-4336

Migraine drugs adverse

---
These drugs are contraindicated in clients with a known hypersensitivity to selective serotonin agonists and should only be used when a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. 5-HT agonists should not be used in clients with ischemic heart disease (such as angina or myocardial infarction), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or uncontrolled hypertension or those clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants. These drugs should be used cautiously in clients with hepatic or renal function impairment, such as the elderly or clients requiring dialysis. Because these are pregnancy category C drugs, they should be used during pregnancy only when the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when administering them to lactating mothers. The ergot derivatives (see Summary Drug Table: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Migraine Medications) should not be used by HIV clients using protease inhibitors or clients taking macrolide antibiotics because of the risk of peripheral ischemia. — location: [7819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7819) ^ref-41657

All opioid analgesics are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs. These drugs are contraindicated in clients with acute bronchial asthma, emphysema, or upper airway obstruction and in clients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. The drugs are also contraindicated in clients with convulsive disorders, severe renal or hepatic dysfunction, and acute ulcerative colitis. The opioid analgesics are pregnancy category C drugs (oxycodone is in pregnancy category B) and are not recommended for use during pregnancy or labor because they may prolong labor or cause respiratory depression in the neonate. The use of opioid analgesics is recommended during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential harm to the fetus. — location: [8362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=8362) ^ref-1120

Antagonists are contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to the opioid antagonists. Antagonists are used cautiously in those who are pregnant (pregnancy category B), in infants of opioid-dependent mothers, and in clients with an opioid dependency or cardiovascular disease. These drugs also are used cautiously during lactation. These drugs may produce withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are physically dependent on the opioid. Antagonists may prevent the action or intended use of opioid antidiarrheals, antitussives, and analgesics. — location: [8461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=8461) ^ref-50336

Estrogen and progestin therapy is contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs, breast cancer (except for metastatic disease), estrogen-dependent neoplasms, undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, and thromboembolic disorders. The progestins also are contraindicated in clients with cerebral hemorrhage or impaired liver function. Both the estrogens and progestins are classified as pregnancy category X drugs and are contraindicated during pregnancy. Estrogens are used cautiously in clients with gallbladder disease, hypercalcemia (may lead to severe hypercalcemia in clients with breast cancer and bone metastasis), cardiovascular disease, and liver impairment. Cardiovascular complications are greater in women who smoke and use estrogen. Progestins are used cautiously in clients with a history of migraine headaches, epilepsy, asthma, and cardiac or renal impairment. — location: [26234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=26234) ^ref-7026

Adverse reactions to these drugs are similar to those with other cholinergic blocking drugs. They include the following: Dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation or diarrhea, decreased production of tears, decreased sweating, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, dim vision, and urinary hesitancy Nausea and vomiting, nervousness, vertigo, headache, rash, and mental confusion (particularly in older adults) When reviewing adverse reactions with a client, it is important to know that before a drug is eliminated consider extended-release (ER) formulas. These drugs release less drug all at one time in the system, as a result, uncomfortable adverse reactions associated with cholinergic blockers are reduced. Clients should be told that antispasmodic drugs can discolor the urine (dark orange to brown) and stain undergarments that come in contact with the urine. — location: [26334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=26334) ^ref-60831

Adverse reactions usually are mild and do not require discontinuing use of the drug. Some of the adverse reactions seen with the administration of alpha-adrenergic blockers are as follows: weight gain, fatigue, dizziness, and transient orthostatic hypotension. Adverse reactions of the AHI drugs, when they occur, are related to the sexual drive and include impotence, decreased libido, and a decreased volume of ejaculation. Changes to breast tissue—pain or tenderness, nipple discharge, or enlargement—can occur while taking AHIs. — location: [26405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=26405) ^ref-41390

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions are primarily gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and include the following: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Abdominal pain or stomatitis Other generalized body system reactions include: Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, weakness, and peripheral neuropathy Rash, pruritus, photosensitivity reactions, and leg cramps When these drugs are given in large doses, clients may experience burning on urination and bladder irritation; this should not be mistaken for a continued infection. Nitrofurantoin has been known to cause acute and chronic pulmonary reactions. Clients should be told that phenazopyridine will discolor the urine (dark orange to brown) and permanently stain undergarments that come in contact with the urine. Contraindications and Precautions Anti-infectives are contraindicated in clients with a hypersensitivity to the drugs and during pregnancy (pregnancy category C) and lactation. One exception is nitrofurantoin, which is classified as a pregnancy category B drug and is used with caution during pregnancy. The anti-infectives should be used cautiously in those with renal or hepatic impairment. Clients who are allergic to tartrazine (a food dye) should not take methenamine (Hiprex). This drug is used cautiously in clients with gout, because it may cause crystals to form in the urine. Nitrofurantoin is used cautiously in clients with cerebral arteriosclerosis, diabetes, or a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. — location: [27046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27046) ^ref-55252

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions from the administration of vaccines or toxoids are usually mild. Chills, fever, muscular aches and pains, rash, and lethargy may be present. Pain and tenderness at the injection site may also occur. Although rare, a hypersensitivity reaction may occur. Some people concerned with egg allergies have refused vaccination. For these individuals, many of the routine vaccines, such as the yearly influenza vaccine, have an alternative preparation that is not made with eggs. The Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents provides a listing of the typical adverse reactions. Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the agent or any component of it. Allergy to eggs is a concern with some vaccines. It is recommended to see a primary health care provider familiar with egg allergies for vaccination if an allergy is suspected. Some people with “hive-only” reactions are able to tolerate vaccines without a problem (ACIP, 2012). The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines are contraindicated in clients who have had an allergic reaction to gelatin, neomycin, or a previous dose of one of the vaccines. The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, because of the danger of birth defects. Women are instructed to avoid becoming pregnant at least 3 months after receiving these vaccines. Vaccines and toxoids are contraindicated during acute febrile illnesses, leukemia, lymphoma, immunosuppressive illness or drug therapy, and nonlocalized cancer. Always ask about allergy history before preparing a vaccine for administration. See Box 47.5 for additional information on the contraindications to immunologic agents. — location: [27503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27503) ^ref-31462

BOX 47.5 Contraindications to Immunization Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever. Anaphylactoid reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing [dyspnea], hypotension, and shock). Known allergy to vaccine or vaccine constituents, particularly gelatin, eggs, or neomycin. Individuals with an immunologic deficiency should not receive a vaccine (virus is transmissible to the immunocompromised individual). Immunizations are postponed during the administration of steroids, radiation therapy, and antineoplastic (anticancer) drug therapy. Viral vaccines against measles, rubella, and mumps should not be given to pregnant women. Clients who experience severe systemic or neurologic reactions after a previous dose of the vaccine should not be given any additional doses. — location: [27517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27517) ^ref-22749

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to immune globulins are rare. However, local tenderness and pain at the injection site may occur. The most common adverse reactions include urticaria, angioedema, erythema, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, headache, chills, and fever. Adverse reactions, if they occur, may last for several hours. Systemic reactions are extremely rare, with the exception of immune globulins given to prevent posttransplant rejection. These immune globulins are made from equine (horse) or rabbit serum and can produce anaphylactic reactions. They should be administered only under the direction of a physician specializing in transplantation medicine. The antivenins may cause various reactions, with hypersensitivity being the most severe. Some antivenins are prepared from equine serum, and if a client is sensitive to equine serum, serious reactions or death may result. The immediate reactions usually occur within 30 min after administration of the antivenin. Symptoms include apprehension; flushing; itching; urticaria; edema of the face, tongue, and throat; cough; dyspnea; vomiting; cyanosis; and collapse. Other adverse reactions are included in the Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents. — location: [27569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27569) ^ref-54215

Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are used with extreme caution in individuals with a history of allergies. Sensitivity testing may be performed in individuals with a history of allergies. Because of the potential harm to a fetus, no adequate studies have been conducted in pregnant women, and it is also not known whether these agents are excreted in breast milk. Thus the immunologic agents (pregnancy category C) are used with caution in pregnant women and during lactation. The immune globulins are contraindicated in clients with a history of allergic reactions after administration of human immunoglobulin preparations and in individuals with isolated immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (individuals could have an anaphylactic reaction to subsequent administration of blood products that contain IgA). — location: [27578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27578) ^ref-3673

Adverse Reactions Because the interferons activate the immune response, a cluster of symptoms similar to fighting influenza occur. These are referred to as “flu-like symptoms” because they mimic the bodily response to fight the flu. Flu-like symptoms generally include: Chills Cough Fever Headache Malaise (generalized discomfort) These adverse reactions are typically treated with acetaminophen and antihistamines. PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS Patti et al. (2020) found that drug administration during evening hours reduced flu-like symptoms compared with those clients who injected themselves in the morning. Other symptoms may include nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, reduced appetite, or diarrhea. Skin rashes, injection pain and inflammation, edema in the extremities, and antibody development can occur. Given parenterally, injection sites are rotated to reduce site reactions. Switching to a drug with less frequent dosing (three times/week to weekly drug) may help reduce injection site irritation and increase client compliance with the dosing schedule. — location: [28057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28057) ^ref-27548

Interferons adverse

---
Contraindications and Precautions Interferons are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, confusion, and manic behavior have been noted in clients both with and without a psychiatric history. Asymptomatic elevation in liver enzyme levels has occurred; therefore, clients should be cautioned regarding alcohol intake while using the drug. Caution is used when administering to clients with cardiac or liver disease, a history of seizure disorder, and thyroid problems. A reduction in WBC count makes clients susceptible to infection. Immunomodulators are not started during pregnancy, unless the woman is at high risk of MS activity. When on interferons, they are stopped when pregnancy is confirmed. Interferon has been found in breast milk (Hale, 2012). — location: [28070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28070) ^ref-28179

Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions CSFs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Filgrastim is used cautiously in clients with hypothyroid disease. The CSFs are pregnancy category C drugs, and caution is used when the client is breastfeeding. Pegfilgrastim can cause a sickle cell crisis in those with the disease. CSFs can cause hypersensitive reactions and should be treated with antihistamines, steroids, and bronchodilators to maintain their use. These drugs can stimulate cancer cell growth in cancer types that are stimulated by growth factors. An even higher increase in neutrophil count can occur when these drugs are taken with lithium, a drug used for the manic phase of mood disorders. — location: [28139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28139) ^ref-1315

Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Thrombopoietin drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. These drugs are used cautiously in clients with renal failure and those with liver failure. Clients should be monitored for cataract (eye) formation. It is a pregnancy category C drug, so women should use effective contraception and lactating clients should stop breastfeeding. Discontinuing either eltrombopag or romiplostim may result in platelet counts lower than the original diagnosed counts. — location: [28165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28165) ^ref-28301

---
Contraindications and Precautions Epoetin alfa is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension, those needing an emergency transfusion, and those with a hypersensitivity to human albumin. Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension or in those allergic to the drug. Polycythemia (an overload of RBCs in the circulation) can occur if the hemoglobin is not carefully monitored and the dosage is too high. This can result in increased mortality, serious cardio or thromboembolic events in any client, and possible tumor progression in cancer clients. Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are used with caution in clients with hypertension, heart disease, congestive heart failure, or a history of seizures. Both these drugs are pregnancy category C drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [28217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28217) ^ref-57676

Contraindications and Precautions Iron supplements are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Iron compounds are contraindicated in clients with hemochromatosis or hemolytic anemia. Iron compounds are used cautiously in clients with hypersensitivity to aspirin because these clients may have a hypersensitivity to the tartrazine or sulfite content of some iron compounds. The parenteral form of iron can cause anaphylactic-type reactions and should be used only when oral supplement is contraindicated. — location: [28247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28247) ^ref-18735

Adverse Reactions Few adverse reactions are associated with the administration of folic acid. Rarely, parenteral administration may result in allergic hypersensitivity. Contraindications and Precautions Folic acid and leucovorin are contraindicated for treating pernicious anemia or for other anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid is a pregnancy category A drug and is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to experience folate deficiency because folic acid requirements increase during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a folate deficiency are at increased risk for complications of pregnancy and fetal abnormalities. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folate during pregnancy is 0.4 mg/day and during lactation, 0.26–0.28 mg/day. Although the potential for fetal harm appears remote, the drug should be used cautiously and only within the RDA guidelines. — location: [28279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28279) ^ref-61924

Adverse Reactions Mild diarrhea and itching have been reported with the administration of vitamin B12. Other adverse reactions that may be seen include a marked increase in RBC production, acne, peripheral vascular thrombosis, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Vitamin B12 is contraindicated in clients who are allergic to cyanocobalamin. Vitamin B12 is a pregnancy category A drug if administered orally and a pregnancy category C drug if given parenterally. Vitamin B12 is administered cautiously during pregnancy and in clients with pulmonary disease and those with anemia. Alcohol, neomycin, and colchicine may decrease the absorption of oral vitamin B12. — location: [28307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28307) ^ref-15790

Adverse Reactions Because these drugs interfere with the immune system, common adverse reactions include headache, chills, and fever. Clients taking biologics may also feel nauseated or experience GI distress. Other adverse reactions experienced are itching, dizziness, and myalgias. Calcineurin inhibitors may cause gum hyperplasia, hair growth, or tremors. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Vaccination with live virus (such as the chickenpox or measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccines) should not be given if the client is on an immunosuppressant agent. Because these agents decrease immunity, there is an increased risk of infection. Therefore, clients should be routinely monitored for neutropenia and infectious diseases. Clients with HIV+ should not take alefacept (used for plaque psoriasis). Calcineurin inhibitors are nephrotoxic in high doses and the BUN should be monitored frequently. Cardiac arrhythmias are more likely to occur if taking calcineurin inhibitors with antiarrhythmic medications. Severe reduction in red cells, white cells, and platelets is seen when those taking IMDH inhibitors are also taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for hypertension. Many of the immunosuppressant agents interact with grapefruit juice and other citrus; consult a clinical nutritionist for client instruction on dietary restrictions. — location: [28715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28715) ^ref-19991

Adverse Reactions Central Nervous System Reactions Headache Dizziness GI System Reactions Nausea Abdominal pain Immune System Reactions Infection, skin eruptions Upper respiratory infection (URI) with cough Antibody development Infusion Reactions Many mAbs are administered intravenously (IV) or by subcutaneous injection. During IV infusion a hypersensitive reaction may occur. This is due to the sensitivity of the client to the tissue of origin of the mAb. Mouse and human tissues are used to make the drugs. When mAbs are composed of more mouse tissue than human tissue, a hypersensitive reaction is more likely to be experienced. Also, infusion-related reactions are more likely to occur during the first infusion than in subsequent treatments. Table 49.1 lists the adverse reactions potentially seen in an infusion reaction. Table 49.1 Components of Infusion Reactions Body System Adverse Reactions Generalized Fever, chills, rigors, sweating, warm feeling Cardiovascular Chest pain, palpitations, hypo-/hypertension, tachy-/bradycardia, arrhythmia, edema, ischemia, infarction, cardiac arrest CNS Throbbing headache, dizziness, confusion, LOC Integumentary Rash, pruritis, urticaria, erythema, tearing, angioedema GI Nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, diarrhea, abdominal cramps/bloating GU Incontinence, uterine cramping, renal impairment Multiple sclerosis Arthralgias, myalgia, fatigue, tumor pain, hypotonia Respiratory Cough, dyspnea, nasal congestion, rhinitis, sneezing, hoarseness, tachypnea, wheezing, tightness, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, stridor, cyanosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome — location: [28768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28768) ^ref-25524

Contraindications and Precautions mAbs should not be used if a person has an active, severe infection. Live vaccine should not be given directly before, during, or immediately after mAb use. Viral infections, such as hepatitis B may be reactivated during therapy, and antiviral treatment should be initiated. Monitor for adverse reactions in clients with cardiac and renal impairment (hypertension and proteinuria). Observe for GI distress, change in bowel habits, and progress to colitis and possible bowel perforation. mAbs can cross the placenta and cause fetal harm; therefore, women are cautioned to use effective birth control and should not use the drug when pregnant. Lactation is discouraged during and 6 months after ending mAb treatment. — location: [28802](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28802) ^ref-6358

Adverse reactions to traditional chemotherapy drugs can be viewed in three different time frames: immediate (during the actual administration), during therapy cycles, and long term (many years later, during survivorship). Immediate adverse reactions occur as a result of administration. These include nausea and vomiting from highly emetic drugs or the potential of intravenous (IV) extravasation (leakage into the surrounding tissues) of irritating solutions. Traditional chemotherapy drugs are potentially toxic, and their administration is often associated with serious adverse reactions. At times, some of these adverse effects are allowed because the only alternative is to stop treatment of cancer. A treatment plan is developed — location: [29405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=29405) ^ref-8744

that will prevent, lessen, or treat most or all of the symptoms of a specific adverse reaction.

BOX 50.1 Emetic Potential of Traditional Chemotherapy Drugs The following drugs have a 60% or greater (levels 4 and 5) chance of causing nausea and vomiting when administered to clients. Alkylating Agents carboplatin carmustine cisplatin cyclophosphamide dacarbazine ifosfamide lomustine mechlorethamine melphalan procarbazine streptozocin. Antibiotics dactinomycin daunorubicin doxorubicin mitoxantrone. Antimetabolites cytarabine methotrexate. Plant Alkaloid irinotecan. An example of a treatment for an adverse reaction is the administration of an antiemetic and IV fluids with electrolytes when severe vomiting is anticipated. When the drugs listed in Box 50.1 are given, antiemetic protocols should always be followed to reduce adverse reactions. Some drugs, such as platinum-based agents, may damage certain organs during administration. Again, prechemotherapy protocols for IV fluid administration are initiated to prevent adverse reactions. Some of these reactions are dose-dependent; that is, their occurrence is more common or their intensity is more severe when multiple doses (or cycles) are used. Because the traditional chemotherapy drugs affect cancer cells and rapidly proliferating normal cells (i.e., cells in the bone marrow, GI tract, reproductive tract, and hair follicles), — location: [29413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=29413) ^ref-777
