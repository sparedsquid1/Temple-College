He weighs 262 lbs and is 5'11\". Initial data collection are blood pressure 152/88 pulse 110, respirations are 26 per minute and temperature is 99.4 F. He is allergic to sulfa drugs and has a history of smoking. He exhibits shortness of breath while talking and increases with movement. Your physical assessment finds ankle edema at +2 bilaterally, pale nailbeds, and no pain. His jugular veins are visible bilaterally. His diet has remained the same, but he shared he has put on 8 pounds in the past 2 weeks. He shares has uses a CPAP machine at night. He reports extreme fatigue with activities and wants to \"just get back to how my life used to be.\" A diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction with heart failure is made by the healthcare team.

Mr. Lepard's Cardiac Catherization Mr. Lepard is having a cardiac catherization today. Nurse to Nurse Report: Mr. Lepard is a 72 year old male status post cardiac catheterization originally admitted for shortness of breath, subsequently with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. He weighs 262 lb and is 5’11’. He is allergic to sulfa drugs and has a 20 year history of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day. He has +2 edema bilaterally on his lower extremities. Conscious sedation with IV Versed and fentanyl was given for the procedure. The cardiac cath. revealed moderate narrowing of 2 coronary arteries of 60% blockage that were treated with angioplasty stents. Cath was introduced in the right femoral artery. All pulses are equal, laterally without evidence of hematoma. Lower extremities are pink, warm, and moving toes. He has reported no pain at the site. He has an 18 gauge IV in the right arm with LR at 125cc per hour with 700 cc left in the bag. Foley catheter is draining clear, amber colored urine, and has had 60 cc per hour of output since procedure. Last vital signs were Temp. 98.6, P 80, R 20, 02 sat 94% on room air, BP 130/70. He has been on bedrest since the procedure, sandbag is in place over the insertion site, and he has a pressure dressing in place under the sandbag. Hospital Provider’s Orders Patient Name: Donald Lepard DOB: 05/09/1949 MRN: 06759820 Date: Time: Order: 2/1/2022 1400 Vital signs & vascular checks: every 15 minutes for 1 hour, every 30 minutes for 2 hours, every 4 hours Diet: Low salt, 2000 calorie, encourage po fluids Activity: bed rest with Right leg immobilized for 6 hours IV Therapy: LR @ 125 cc/hr Foley catheter: Discontinue catheter in AM Intake and Output: monitor I&O and report to provider output less than 30cc per hour Medications: Metoprolol 25 mg po 0900 Lipitor (Atorvastatin) 10 mg po 0900 Morphine Sulfate 4 mg IV every 4 hours prn chest pain, may repeat once Diagnostic Studies: 12 Lead ECG every AM Place on telemetry monitoring Clinical Questions: • What are safety concerns for Mr. Lepard? • What would you expect to be on the insertion site? • What assessments would you focus on? • What signs and symptoms would indicate hypovolemia related to blood loss? • What is a major concerns with the use of the radiological dye to what organ? Clinical Questions: • Cardiac catheterization is most performed via access through right femoral artery. After catheterization, the nurse conducts a routine pulse assessment. Which pulses are typically checked? • Mr. Lepard’s vital signs before the procedure were: Temp. 98.6, P 80, R 20, 02 sat 94% on room air, BP 130/70. After the procedure, his vital signs are temp 97.6, P 115, R 24, 02 sat 90% on room air, BP 90/50. • These findings suggest: Normal findings? Hypovolemia? Pain? DVT? • What may you expect to see when assessing his insertion site? • Mr. Lepard is needing 1 unit of packed red blood cells. You assess his IV site and noticed that he has an 18 gauge catheter in his right arm. You believe that you can use the site to administer the blood, because…","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
