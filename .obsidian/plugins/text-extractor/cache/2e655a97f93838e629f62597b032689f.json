A nurse is preparing to administer ciprofloxacin as prescribed. Which test would the nurse ensure is completed before administering the first dose to the client? A) Urinalysis B) Culture tests C) Ulcer tests D) Stool tests Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should check whether culture tests are conducted before the first dose of drug is administered to the client. Ulcer tests and stool tests are not required to be conducted before administering the first dose of an anti-infective drug to the client. The nurse has to ensure that urinalysis is conducted before the administration of the drug but not specifically before the first dose of the anti-infective drug.

A client is questioning the nurse about a superinfection that developed while receiving fluoroquinolone therapy. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “Your infection was really severe, so the drug wasn't as effective as it could have been.” B) “This happens when your original infection begins to clear.” C) “The drug disrupts your normal bacteria so it allows other organisms to grow.” D) “We really don't know why this happens; it just does sometimes.” Answer: C Rationale: Antibiotics can disrupt the normal flora (nonpathogenic bacteria in the bowel), causing a secondary infection or superinfection. This new infection is “superimposed” on the original infection. The destruction of large numbers of nonpathogenic bacteria (normal flora) by the antibiotic alters the chemical environment. This allows uncontrolled growth of bacteria or fungal microorganisms that are not affected by the antibiotic being administered. It has nothing to do with the drug's effectiveness or the original infection being cleared. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 9 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 109, Superinfections 4. A client develops pseudomembranous colitis secondary to fluoroquinolone therapy. The nurse anticipates the bowel culture will grow which organism? A) E. coli B) C. difficile C) Staphylococcus D) Group B hemolytic Streptococcus Answer: B Rationale: Pseudomembranous colitis is one type of a bacterial superinfection. This potentially life-threatening problem develops because of an overgrowth of the microorganism Clostridium difficile (C. diff) in the bowel.

The nurse is evaluating the medical records of several clients and note some are receiving both fluoroquinolone and corticosteroid therapy. The nurse concludes which client is at the greatest risk for tendonitis? A) 34-year-old female B) 22-year-old male C) 45-year-old female D) 72-year-old male Answer: D Rationale: Tendonitis and tendon rupture risk increase when taking a fluoroquinolone. Although this can happen at any age, those older than 60 years who also take corticosteroids are at greater risk.

The nurse is administering fluoroquinolone and ibuprofen to a client. The nurse should be alert for which potential adverse reaction? A) Increased risk for bleeding B) Decreased effectiveness of the fluoroquinolone C) Increased risk for seizures D) Delayed elimination of the fluoroquinolone Answer: C Rationale: When a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen is used in conjunction with a fluoroquinolone, the client has an increased risk for seizures. An increased risk of bleeding would occur with oral anticoagulants in conjunction with fluoroquinolone therapy. Decreased effectiveness of the fluoroquinolone would occur if it was given with antacids, iron salts, or zinc because of decreased absorption of the antibiotic. Cimetidine interferes with the elimination of the fluoroquinolone, leading to prolonged presence of the drug in the bloodstream.

A nurse is preparing to teach a client about fluoroquinolones. The nurse will explain the importance of taking which drug on an empty stomach? A) Ciprofloxacin B) Moxifloxacin C) Levofloxacin D) Norfloxacin Answer: D Rationale: Although any of the fluoroquinolones can be given on an empty stomach, it is essential that norfloxacin is given in such a manner. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 9 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 111, Promoting an Optimal Response to Therapy 8. A client receiving levofloxacin tells the nurse, “I used sunscreen but it didn't help.” Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “Be sure to wear long sleeves and a wide-brimmed hat in addition to using sunscreen.” B) “I guess you didn't apply enough sunscreen to be effective.” C) “Maybe we need to change your medication because this is unusual.” D) “The sunscreen should have worked. Are you sure you actually did use it?” Answer: A Rationale: The fluoroquinolone drugs cause severe photosensitivity reactions. Clients may experience “sunburn” reactions even when they use sunscreen or sunblock products. Caution clients to wear cover-up clothing with long sleeves and wide-brimmed hats when outside in addition to sunblock preparations. Remind them that sunscreen needs to be applied repeatedly throughout the day or when going into water. Clients should be aware that glare during hazy or cloudy days can cause skin reactions as readily as direct sunlight on a clear day. Telling the client that they didn't apply enough or questioning the client's actual use of sunscreen is inappropriate. There is no need to change the medication because the client's report is not unusual.

The nurse is explaining to a client the proper way to take extended-release fluoroquinolone. Which instruction would be most important to include in the client's teaching plan? A) To chew, crush, or break the medication B) To swallow the medication whole C) To limit the daily fluid intake D) To take the drug with an antacid Answer: B Rationale: When an extended-release formulation is prescribed, the client needs instructions to swallow the medication whole and not to chew, crush, or break the medication. Otherwise, the amount of drug released would be too great for the body all at once. Clients should be encouraged to increase their fluid intake and to separate administration by 1 to 2 hours.

A client develops a severe case of pseudomembranous colitis secondary to fluoroquinolone therapy. The fluoroquinolone is stopped immediately and intravenous fluids and protein supplementation are started. The nurse would also expect to administer which new medication? A) Fidaxomicin B) Metronidazole C) Norfloxacin D) Moxifloxacin Answer: A Rationale: Moderate to severe cases of pseudomembranous colitis may require treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with drugs such as fidaxomicin (Dificid) to eliminate the microorganism. Metronidazole is used to treat infections involving anaerobic organisms. Norfloxacin and moxifloxacin are fluoroquinolones and would not be used.

A client asks the nurse how fluoroquinolones work. What is the nurse's best response? A) They inhibit the growth of the bacteria. B) They disrupt the cell membrane of the bacteria. C) They interfere with the DNA of the bacteria. D) They promote WBC development from the bone marrow. Answer: C Rationale: Fluoroquinolones exert their bactericidal effect by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial DNA. This interference prevents cell reproduction, causing death of the bacterial cell. Penicillins disrupt the cell membrane of the bacteria. Bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit the growth of bacteria. There are not antibiotics that promote WBC development from the bone marrow.

A nurse is administering ciprofloxacin IV. What should the nurse assess prior to administering the medication? A) Assess vital signs. B) Call the prescriber for orders. C) Place another IV site for administration. D) Inspect the needle site for signs of tenderness, pain, and redness. Answer: D Rationale: For intravenously administered fluoroquinolones, the nurse should inspect the needle site and the area around the needle prior to administering the medication. Inspect the vein used for the IV infusion every 4 hours for signs of tenderness, pain, and redness. If the site is inflamed or has redness, another IV site can be started. The prescriber does not need to be called. Vital signs are not warranted with IV administration of ciprofloxacin.
