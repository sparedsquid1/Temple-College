Texture is firm and leathery. • No pain because nerve endings are destroyed, unless surrounded by areas of partial thickness burns. • Grafting is necessary to complete healing Common Causes of Burns Flame • House fire; associated with inhalation injury Contact • Hot tar, metals, grease; produces a full thickness injury Scalding • Hot liquid; common in children, scalding with immersion, usually no splash marks Chemical • Industrial settings; extent depends on chemical and duration of contact Electrical • Most serious type; can be full thickness with possible loss of limbs Radiation • Industrial settings, treatment of disease, or ultraviolet light; severity depends on type, duration, distance, and absorbed dose 10/22/2024 6 Diagnostic Tests • History and physical • Complete blood count (C B C) • Blood urea nitrogen • Glucose • Electrolytes • Serum protein, albumin • Urine cultures • Clotting studies • X-rays • Electrocardiogram • Arterial blood gases (A B G’s) • Cultures Therapeutic Measures for Major Burns • Emergent stage • A B C’s (airway, breathing, circulation) • Stop burning process. • Stabilize related injuries. • I V fluids • Pain control • Give prior to dressing changes • IV quickest route 10/22/2024 7 Therapeutic Measures for Major Burns • Acute stage • Clean, debride, dress. • Prevent infection. • Skin grafting if needed. • Control pain. • Maintain nutrition and fluid and electrolyte balance. • Nutrition Notes on Burns page 1143 • Monitor for complications. • Check return of distal pulses is escharotomy is done Skin Grafts • Autograft (clients own unburned skin) • Split-thickness skin graft (S T S G) • Full-thickness skin graft (F T S G) 10/22/2024 8 Rehabilitation Stage • Reconstructive surgery • Prevent contracture • Physical therapy • Psychosocial care Nursing Diagnoses • Impaired Gas Exchange • Impaired Skin Integrity • Deficient Fluid Volume • Acute Pain • Impaired Physical Mobility • Ineffective Peripheral Tissue Perfusion • Risk for Infection 10/22/2024 9 Vocabulary _____ Leathery skin, usually painless _____ Pink to red moist skin; blisters may be present _____ Removal of a slough or scab formed on skin and underlying tissue of severely burned skin _____ Epidermis and dermis involved; pain from exposed nerve endings _____ Hard scab or dry crust from necrotic tissue A. Debridement B. Eschar C. Superficial partial-thickness burn D. Partial-thickness deep burn E. Full-thickness burn A client is brought in the ED with burns over 40% of the body from an apartment fire. Which assessment should take priority? A. Burn depth B. Percent of body surface burned C. Respiratory status D. Circulatory status 10/22/2024 10 A home health care nurse visits an 82-year-old client. On entering the home, the nurse finds that the client has dropped a pot of boiling water on both legs. What action should the nurse take first? A. Call 911 B. Remove the clothing from the affected area C. Place ice on the affected area D. Assess the extent of the burn","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
