Meninges of the Brain 13. Identify the meningeal (or associated) structures described below: 1. outermost meninx covering the brain; composed of tough fibrous connective tissue 2. innermost meninx covering the brain; delicate and highly vascular 3. structures instrumental in returning cerebrospinal fluid to the venous blood in the dural sinuses 4. structure that forms the cerebrospinal fluid 5. middle meninx; like a cobweb in structure 6. its outer layer forms the periosteum of the skull 7. a dural fold that attaches the cerebrum to the crista galli of the skull 8. a dural fold separating the cerebrum from the cerebellum Cerebrospinal Fluid 14. Label the structures involved with circulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the accompanying diagram. Cerebrospinal fluid flows from the fourth ventricle into the central canal of the spinal cord and the _______ space surrounding the brain and spinal cord. From this space it drains through the _______ into the _______. 1. 2. 3. Add arrows to the figure above to indicate the flow of cerebrospinal fluid from its formation in the lateral ventricles to the site of its exit from the fourth ventricle. Then fill in the blanks in the following paragraph.

Choose the proper answer from the following key to respond to the descriptions relating to spinal cord anatomy. Key: a. sensory b. motor c. both sensory and motor d. interneurons 1. neuron type found in dorsal horn 4. fiber type in ventral root 2. neuron type found in ventral horn 5. fiber type in dorsal root 3. neuron type in dorsal root ganglion 6. fiber type in spinal nerve 4. Where in the vertebral column is a lumbar puncture generally done? Why is this the site of choice? 5. The spinal cord is enlarged in two regions, the and the regions. What is the significance of these enlargements? 6. How does the position of the gray and white matter differ in the spinal cord and the cerebral hemispheres? 7. From the key, choose the name of the tract that might be damaged when the following conditions are observed. (More than one choice may apply.) 1. uncoordinated movement 2. lack of voluntary movement 3. tremors, jerky movements 4. diminished pain perception 5. diminished sense of touch Key: a. dorsal columns (fasciculus cuneatus and fasciculus gracilis) b. lateral corticospinal tract c. ventral corticospinal tract d. tectospinal tract e. rubrospinal tract f. vestibulospinal tract g. lateral spinothalamic tract h. ventral spinothalamic tract i. dorsal spinocerebellar tract j. ventral spinocerebellar tract Dissection of the Spinal Cord 8. Compare and contrast the meninges of the spinal cord and the brain. 9. How can you distinguish between the dorsal and ventral horns? d b a b a c Between L3 and L4 or L4 and L5. The spinal cord ends at the level of L2; thus there is little chance of damaging it below that level. cervical lumbar Nerves serving the limbs issue from these regions of the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, the white matter surrounds the gray matter. In the cerebral hemisphere, there is an outer “rind” of gray matter and deep to that is white matter with a few scattered islands of gray matter. d, e, f b, c d, e, f g a, h Both the spinal cord and the brain have three meninges: pia mater, arachnoid mater, and dura mater. In the brain the dura mater has two layers—periosteal and meningeal. The spinal cord has only the meningeal layer. In the spinal cord there exists an epidural space between the vertebral bone and the dura, but the dura of the brain is tightly adhered to the skull. The ventral horns are wider than the dorsal horns. The dorsal horns extend closer to the edge of the spinal cord.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
