Learning Outcomes (continued)  Plan preparation and postprocedure care for patients undergoing diagnostic tests of the urinary system.  Plan nursing care for patients with incontinence.  Discuss nursing actions to decrease the risk of infection in urinary catheterized patients. Urinary Anatomy and Physiology  Two kidneys  Two ureters  Urinary bladder  Urethra Interior of the Kidney https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DuBWFd5r2cNephron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CShAIAD-ask Kidney Function  Formation of urine  Excretion or conservation of water  Electrolyte balance  Acid–base balance  Activation of vitamin D  Production of erythropoietin  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCjSGr-ywFU  Production of renin Glomerular Filtration Rate  Renal filtrate the kidneys form in 1 minute  Averages 100 to 125 milliliter per minute Glomerular FiltrationUreters, Urinary Bladder, and Urethra  Ureters • Carry urine from kidneys to bladder  Bladder • Temporary storage of urine and its elimination  Urethra • Carries urine from bladder to exterior Normal Urine Characteristics  Amount • 1,000 to 2,000 milliliter per 24 hours  Color • Pale yellow to amber  Appearance • Clear  Specific gravity: 1.005 to 1.030 • Lower = dilute • Higher = concentrated Aging and the Urinary SystemAging and the Urinary System (continued)  Renal mass smaller  Renal flow decreased 50%  Decreased tubular function  Bladder muscles weaken  Bladder capacity decreases  Voiding reflex delayed Nursing Assessment  Kidney disease can affect every body system.  Health history  Pain in the flank area  Burning with voiding  New onset edema, shortness of breath, weight gain  Fluid intake  Functional ability Physical Assessment  Vital signs • High blood pressure occurs with kidney disease  Lung sounds • Crackles indicate fluid overload  Edema • Indicates fluid overload Physical Assessment (continued)  Daily weights • Best indicator of fluid balance  Intake and output • Medication and fluid orders depend upon the accuracy of measurement  Skin • Yellow or gray cast • Uremic frost Laboratory Tests  Urinalysis • First morning specimen best (unless for cytology) • Overnight cell changes can affect the accuracy of the cytology analysis • Voided or sterile catheter specimen • 10 milliliter of urine collected • Examine within 1 hour or refrigerate • Random specimens collected for cytology Normal Urine Characteristics (continued)  p H • 4.5 to 8.0  Constituents • 95% water • Waste products: Urea, creatinine, uric acid Laboratory Tests (continued_1)  Composite urine specimen: 24-hour urine • Patient instructed to void and discard urine • Time recorded as the start time of test • Exactly at 24 hours, patient instructed to void • Urine added to collection device and test ends • Incomplete urine collection cause inaccurate results Laboratory Tests (continued_2)  Urine culture • Identifies organisms present ‒ Often bacteria • Urine specimen collected before antibiotic given • Sensitivity test identifies antibiotic that will destroy bacteria Laboratory Tests (continued_3)  Renal function tests • Serum creatinine • Blood urea nitrogen • Serum uric acid • Creatinine clearance test • Glomerular filtration rate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVXY7xLwNJQ","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
