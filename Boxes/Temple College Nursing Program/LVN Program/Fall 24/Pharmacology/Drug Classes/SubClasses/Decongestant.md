### Adverse Reactions 
When used topically in prescribed doses, there are usually minimal systemic effects in most individuals. On occasion, nasal burning, stinging, and dryness may be seen. When the topical form is used frequently or if the liquid is swallowed, the same adverse reactions seen with the oral decongestants may occur. Use of oral decongestants may result in the following adverse reactions: 
- Tachycardia and other cardiac arrhythmias 
- Nervousness, restlessness, and insomnia 
- Blurred [[Vision]] 
- Nausea and vomiting

### Contraindications
Decongestants are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity and in clients taking [[MAOI]] antidepressants. Sustained-release [[pseudoephedrine]] is contraindicated in children younger than 12 Â  years.
