Self-evaluation is part of the Texas Nursing Practice Act, Rule 217.11, (G) (Obtaining Instruction/Supervision) which states the nurse must “obtain instruction and supervision as necessary when implementing nursing procedures or practices.” This requires the nurse performs self- evaluation to determine when instruction and supervision will be needed. For each criterion on the self-evaluation tool, the student needs to think about their clinical performance for the rotation and rate themselves with a 0, 1, 2, or 3 (Refer to the Rating Scale of Clinical Performance). The student should provide reasons and rationale for their rating. The student should cite specific clinical examples as part of the rationale. You do not need to complete the gray areas. Example: A. Assessment * 1. Performs assessment accurately to assist in identifying health status and monitoring change in patient’s condition. On 1/16/2022 at 0900, assessments completed with instructor assistance on lung sounds and cardiovascular assessment. Student information will be reviewed by the faculty for accuracy and depth of self-evaluation. Remember, the faculty probably know the big thing things you did but may not know everything you did. Be sure to document everything you can to support your rating. However, the student who gives themselves all “3’s” is probably not being realistic. Usually, people are good at things and need to work on others. Be realistic in your self-evaluation. Where are your strengths? What areas need improvement? In the comment section of the Self-Evaluation tool, discuss HOW you plan to address the areas needing improvement. What things can you do (appointments in the Sim lab, further practice/study on topic) to improve your performance in these areas. The key is NOT to pretend you are practically perfect in every way. The key is to be realistic and honest with yourself and your clinical instructor. Identify the areas in which you excel and those needing improvement. Identify how to plan to address the areas needing improvement. This is part of being a professional nurse.
