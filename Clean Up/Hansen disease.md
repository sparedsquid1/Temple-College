Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium leprae*. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, [[Mucosa]] of the upper [[Respiratory]] tract, and eyes. Hansen's disease has been known since ancient times and is often associated with significant social stigma.

### Symptoms:
- **Skin Lesions:**
  - Hypopigmented or reddish patches with loss of sensation
  - Thickened dermis
  - Nodules or plaques
- **Nerve Damage:**
  - Numbness in the affected areas
  - Muscle weakness
  - Nerve thickening
- **Other Symptoms:**
  - Ulcers on the soles of feet
  - Facial disfigurement (in advanced cases)
  - Eye problems leading to blindness if untreated

### Transmission:
- **Primarily through [[Respiratory]] droplets:**
  - Prolonged, close contact with an infected person is usually necessary for transmission.
  - *Mycobacterium leprae* cannot be easily spread and has low pathogenicity.

### Types:
- **Tuberculoid Leprosy:**
  - Milder form
  - Few skin lesions and peripheral nerve involvement
  - Strong immune response
- **Lepromatous Leprosy:**
  - More severe form
  - Widespread skin bumps and rashes
  - Extensive nerve damage
  - Weak immune response
- **Borderline Leprosy:**
  - Features of both tuberculoid and lepromatous types
  - Can shift toward either extreme

### Diagnosis:
- **Clinical Examination:**
  - Based on skin lesions and sensory loss
- **Skin Biopsy:**
  - Histopathological examination to detect *Mycobacterium leprae*
- **Skin Smear:**
  - To identify acid-fast bacilli
- **Serological Tests:**
  - Limited use; not definitive

### Treatment:
- **Multidrug Therapy (MDT):**
  - A combination of antibiotics, typically including [[dapsone]], rifampicin, and clofazimine.
  - Duration: 6 months for paucibacillary leprosy and 12 months or longer for multibacillary leprosy.
- **Supportive Care:**
  - Management of complications, such as nerve damage and ulcer care.
  - Physical therapy to prevent disability.

### Prognosis:
- **Good with Early Diagnosis and Treatment:**
  - Treatment can cure the disease and prevent further damage.
- **Complications:**
  - If untreated, can lead to severe deformities, nerve damage, and secondary infections.

### Prevention:
- **Early Detection and Treatment:**
  - Reduces the risk of transmission.
- **Contact Tracing and Prophylaxis:**
  - Screening and treating close [[Boxes/Templates/Contacts|Contacts]] of infected individuals.
- **Public Education:**
  - Reducing stigma and promoting awareness about the disease's low contagion risk.

### Social Implications:
- **Stigma and Discrimination:**
  - Historical and cultural stigma still exists in many parts of the world.
- **Rehabilitation and Reintegration:**
  - Programs to support the social and economic reintegration of affected individuals.

Hansen's disease is curable, and early treatment can prevent most complications. However, public health efforts are essential to eliminate stigma and ensure early diagnosis and treatment.
