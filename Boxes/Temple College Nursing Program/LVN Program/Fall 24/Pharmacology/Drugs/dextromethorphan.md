### Mechanisms of Action
#### Dextromethorphan - Mechanism of Action and Nursing Considerations

**Mechanism of Action (MOA):**

- **Dextromethorphan** is a **cough suppressant** ([[Antitussive]]) that works by acting on the **cough center** in the **medulla** of the brain.
- It **inhibits** the **NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)** receptor, which plays a role in transmitting signals related to cough reflex.
- It also acts on the **sigma receptors**, contributing to its effects on cough suppression.
- Dextromethorphan does not have the sedative or analgesic properties of opioids, but at high doses, it can have **psychoactive effects**.

**Nursing Considerations:**

1. **Assess the Cough**:
    
    - Evaluate whether the cough is productive or non-productive, as dextromethorphan should be used for dry, non-productive coughs.
    - Avoid use in patients with chronic productive cough (e.g., with asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis) unless directed by a healthcare provider.
2. **Drug Interactions**:
    
    - Caution in patients using **[[Monoamine]] oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)** or within **14 days** of stopping an [[MAOI]], as it can lead to **[[serotonin syndrome]]**.
    - May interact with **SSRIs**, **SNRIs**, and other **serotonergic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]**, increasing the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]].
3. **Monitor for Abuse Potential**:
    
    - Dextromethorphan has a **low abuse potential** at therapeutic doses, but at **high doses**, it can be misused for its **hallucinogenic effects**.
    - Educate patients to avoid exceeding the recommended dose.
4. **Side Effects**:
    
    - Most common side effects include **drowsiness**, **dizziness**, **nausea**, and **vomiting**.
    - Rare but serious effects include **[[serotonin syndrome]]** (confusion, agitation, [[Fever]], sweating, tachycardia).
5. **Use in Children**:
    
    - Avoid use in children under 2 years old due to the risk of serious side effects.
    - For children aged 2–6 years, consult a pediatrician before use.
6. **Monitor Renal and Hepatic Function**:
    
    - Use with caution in patients with **renal** or **hepatic impairment**, as dosing adjustments may be necessary.
7. **Encourage Fluid Intake**:
    
    - Encourage the patient to **drink plenty of fluids** to help loosen mucus and ease coughing.
