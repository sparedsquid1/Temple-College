Nonâ€“[[SCLC]] (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] lung cancer cases. It is a category that encompasses several subtypes of lung cancers that behave in a similar way and are treated similarly. NSCLC tends to grow and spread more slowly than [[SCLC]] ([[SCLC]]).

### Subtypes of NSCLC:
1. **Adenocarcinoma**: The most common subtype of NSCLC, particularly in non-smokers. It usually begins in cells that line the alveoli and is often found in the outer areas of the lungs.
   
2. **Squamous Cell [[Carcinoma]]**: Typically linked to smoking, this subtype begins in the flat cells that line the airways of the lungs. It is often found in the central part of the lungs, near the main bronchus.

3. **Large Cell [[Carcinoma]]**: A less common and more aggressive form of NSCLC, this subtype can appear in any part of the lung and tends to grow and spread quickly.

### Risk Factors:
- **Smoking**: The primary risk factor, with a higher risk associated with longer and heavier smoking habits.
- **Secondhand Smoke**: Exposure to tobacco smoke even if not actively smoking.
- **Radon Exposure**: A radioactive gas found in homes that increases lung cancer risk.
- **Occupational Hazards**: Exposure to asbestos, diesel exhaust, or certain chemicals.
- **Genetic Factors**: Family history of lung cancer may increase risk.
- **Air Pollution**: Prolonged exposure to polluted air.

### Symptoms:
- **Persistent Cough**: Often the first symptom, which may worsen over time.
- **Coughing up [[Blood]] (Hemoptysis)**: A more serious sign that should prompt immediate medical attention.
- **Shortness of Breath**: Due to tumor growth blocking airways.
- **Chest Pain**: Can occur if the cancer spreads to the chest wall or ribs.
- **Hoarseness**: If the cancer affects the nerves controlling the voice box.
- **Unexplained Weight Loss** and **Fatigue**.

### Diagnosis:
- **Imaging Tests**: Chest X-rays, CT scans, and PET scans are used to detect lung tumors.
- **Biopsy**: Confirmatory diagnosis by taking a tissue sample, usually through bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or surgery.
- **Molecular Testing**: Identifies specific genetic mutations or protein markers in the cancer cells, which can influence treatment options.

### Staging:
NSCLC is staged from I (localized) to IV (metastatic), based on the size of the tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and the spread to other parts of the body.

### Treatment:
Treatment varies depending on the stage, subtype, and overall health of the patient:

- **Surgery**: Often used in early-stage cancer to remove the tumor or part of the lung.
- **Radiation Therapy**: Used to target and kill cancer cells, often combined with other treatments.
- **Chemotherapy**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that kill rapidly dividing cells, used in various stages of NSCLC.
- **Targeted Therapy**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that specifically target genetic mutations or proteins in cancer cells, such as [[EGFR Inhibitors]] or ALK inhibitors.
- **Immunotherapy**: Uses the body's immune system to fight cancer, often used in advanced NSCLC.
- **Palliative Care**: To relieve symptoms and improve quality of life, especially in advanced stages.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for NSCLC depends on the stage at diagnosis. Early-stage cancers have a better prognosis, with potential for surgical cure, while advanced-stage NSCLC typically has a poorer prognosis, but treatment advances, especially in targeted and immunotherapy, are improving outcomes for many patients.
