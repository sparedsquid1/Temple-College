   - **Skin Disorders:** Conditions like lichen sclerosus or eczema can cause pain.
   - **[[Endometriosis]]:** A condition where tissue similar to the lining of the [[uterus]] grows outside the [[uterus]].
   - **Vaginal Atrophy:** Thinning and inflammation of the vaginal walls due to decreased [[estrogen]], especially after [[menopause]].
   - **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):** Infection of the female reproductive organs.

**2. Psychological Causes:**
   - **[[anxiety]] or Stress:** About sexual performance or relationships.
   - **Trauma:** A history of sexual abuse or trauma.
   - **[[Depression]]:** Can affect sexual desire and the physical experience of sex.
