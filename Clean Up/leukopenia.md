**Leukopenia** refers to a decrease in the number of white [[Blood]] cells (leukocytes) in the [[Blood]], which can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections. White [[Blood]] cells play a crucial role in defending the body against pathogens, so having a lower count can make it harder for the body to fight off infections.

### Causes of Leukopenia:
Leukopenia can result from various conditions and factors, including:
1. **Bone Marrow Disorders**: Conditions like [[Leukemia]], myelodysplastic syndromes, or [[aplastic anemia]] affect the bone marrow's ability to produce white [[Blood]] cells.
2. **Infections**: Severe viral infections, such as HIV, [[hepatitis]], or influenza, can temporarily reduce white [[Blood]] cell counts.
3. **Medications**: Certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or [[Immunosuppressants]], can lower white [[Blood]] cell production.
4. **Autoimmune Disorders**: Diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can lead to leukopenia when the immune system attacks the bodyâ€™s own tissues, including white [[Blood]] cells.
5. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Deficiencies in essential [[Vitamins]] and [[minerals]], particularly vitamin [[B12]], folate, and copper, can lead to decreased white [[Blood]] cell production.
6. **Chronic Illnesses**: Conditions like [[Liver]] disease or kidney failure can indirectly lead to leukopenia.

### Symptoms:
Leukopenia itself may not cause noticeable symptoms, but because it weakens the immune system, it increases susceptibility to infections. Common signs include:
- Frequent infections
- [[Fever]] or chills
- [[Mouth]] ulcers
- Sore throat
- Fatigue

### Diagnosis:
Leukopenia is typically diagnosed through a **complete [[Blood]] count (CBC)** test, which measures the levels of different types of [[Blood]] cells. A white [[Blood]] cell count lower than 4,000 cells per microliter of [[Blood]] is generally considered leukopenic, but the normal range can vary.

### Treatment:
The treatment of leukopenia depends on its underlying cause:
- **Infections**: Antibiotics or antiviral medications may be prescribed if an infection is present.
- **Medications**: If leukopenia is caused by medication, adjusting the dose or switching to an alternative may help.
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Supplements may be recommended to address deficiencies in nutrients like vitamin [[B12]] or folate.
- **Bone Marrow Disorders**: More aggressive treatments such as bone marrow transplants, growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), or chemotherapy may be necessary for serious conditions.

### Management:
In individuals with chronic or severe leukopenia, precautions to avoid infections may include good hygiene, avoiding contact with sick individuals, and possibly avoiding certain foods or environments that may harbor bacteria.
