Epistaxis is the medical term for a nosebleed, which is the bleeding from the [[Blood]] vessels in the nasal cavity. It can occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma, infection, dry air, or underlying medical conditions such as hypertension or [[Blood]] clotting disorders. There are two main types of epistaxis:

1. **Anterior Epistaxis**: This type occurs at the front part of the nasal septum and is the most common. It usually originates from a network of [[Blood]] vessels called Kiesselbach's plexus.
2. **Posterior Epistaxis**: This type occurs in the back part of the nasal cavity and is less common but often more severe. It usually originates from branches of the sphenopalatine artery.

Management of epistaxis may include pinching the nostrils, applying cold compresses, nasal packing, or medical treatment to address underlying causes.
