(Margo McCaffery, 1999) 1 2 8/5/2024 2 DEFINE PAIN  Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. (IASP, 2009) WHY DOES PAIN EXIST?  Warning sign  Prevents further injury 3 4 8/5/2024 3 DEFINE SUFFERING  Suffering represents a threat to one’s self-image or life. Suffering is not synonymous with pain but is closely associated with it. Physical pain is closely related to psychological, social, and spiritual distress. Pain that persists without meaning becomes suffering. ( Ferrell and Coyle, 2008)  Suffering can be relieved if the pain is relieved CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS R/T PAIN  Box on Cultural Considerations on page 122 – Review  Culture can affect  Expression and meaning of pain  Assessment of pain  Patient’s preferences  Interventions for pain relief  Never make assumptions 5 6 8/5/2024 4 TERMS TO KNOW  Opioid  A narcotic drug with morphine like effect  Physical Dependence  After a few weeks of opioid use, withdrawal symptoms occur if the drug is immediately discontinued  Psychological Dependence  Compulsive use, craving, using when there is no pain present, addiction TERMS TO KNOW  Tolerance  Normal biological adaptation. It takes more medication to achieve the same relief  Ceiling Effect  The dose of medication which the maximum therapeutic effect is achieved 7 8 8/5/2024 5 MYTH VS. FACT WHEN TREATING PAIN  A laughing person is not hurting  If morphine is given too early to the patient with cancer pain, it will not work when the patient really needs it, toward the end, when the pain is the worst  Respiratory depression is common in patient’s receiving opioid pain medications  Pain medication is more effective when given by an injection “CLOCK WATCHER” A person who watches the clock and knows exactly when his/her next dose of medication is due is a drug seeker. Myth or Fact? 9 10 8/5/2024 6 CRITICAL THINKING QUESTION:  Your patient says, “I don’t want to take the Vicodin too often because I don’t want to become addicted.” How might you respond? PAIN TRANSMISSION  Nociception  Result of tissue Damage  Usually time-limited and resolves when damaged tissue heals  Somatic:  Bones and joints, connective tissue, muscles…  Described as sharp or dull and aching  Can localize site and may be worse with movement  Visceral:  Involve organs and internal structures  May be crampy or dull and aching  Difficult to localize  Neuropathic  Nerve Damage: numb, burning, tingling, crawling, stabbing, etc.  Difficult to describe; not typical “pain”  Almost always a chronic condition 11 12 8/5/2024 7 TYPES OF PAIN  Acute Pain  Less than 3 months  Chronic Pain  More than 3 months  Cancer-related Pain  Chronic Nonmalignant pain  Referred pain  Pain felt in a part of the body other than it’s actual source PAIN TREATMENT  Analgesics  Opioids  Nonopioids  Adjuvants  Opioid Antagonists  Other Treatments 13 14 8/5/2024 8 NONOPIOD ANALGESICS  Used to treat mild pain  Have a ceiling effect  Do not produce tolerance or physical dependence  Includes NSAIDS and Acetaminophen OPIOID ANALGESICS  High Alert Drug  Should be increased gradually to tolerate S/E  If used for an extended time, gradually taper down dose to prevent withdrawal symptoms  Can be added to nonopioids  No ceiling effect  Watch for respiratory depression and sedation  Can be short and long acting  If the patient is on a long acting, must also have short acting medication  Morphine, Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), Meperidine(Demerol), Fentanyl(Duragesic), Methadone 15 16 8/5/2024 9 MEPERIDINE (DEMEROL)  Not recommended for most patients  Produces a cerebral irritant when broken down in the body  Can cause irritable moods to seizures  Avoid in people over 65, impaired renal fx, or taking a MAOI antidepressant  Only use in young healthy people for a very short amount of time  PO dose not recommended  Three to four times stronger METHADONE  Longer duration than morphine  Works great when given PO  Can be used to help with detox from heroin and other opioids  Do not discontinue if a patient is on Methadone maintenance.  May need to add to if a patient has pain after trauma/surgery 17 18 8/5/2024 10 OPIOID ANTAGONISTS  Naloxone (Narcan)  Counteracts all opioids  Used for over sedation or respiratory depression  Difficult to arouse and constricted pupils  Also counteracts pain control  Client’s will begin to have pain again ANALGESIC ADJUVANTS  Enhance analgesics, have analgesic activity, or counteract side effects of other analgesics  Corticosteroids  Acute/chronic cancer pain  Benzodiazepine  Anxiety or muscle pain  Antidepressants  Nerve pain  Anticonvulsants  Nerve pain  Stimulants  Counteract sedating effects 19 20 8/5/2024 11 PLACEBOS Administered inactive substitutes for analgesics Not Justified in the Treatment of Pain SCHEDULING OPTIONS  Pain meds can be given scheduled or prn  PCA: Patient controlled analgesia  A lock-out method prevents the patient from receiving too much medication  Has a PCA dose and a continuous/basal rate  Educate family that only the client is allowed to push the PCA button to administer medication 21 22 8/5/2024 12 WHO LADDER (WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION) ROUTES FOR ANALGESIC ADMINISTRATION TABLE 10.3  Oral  Preferred route  Rectal  Used when client cannot take oral medications  Transdermal Patch  May take up to 3 days before maximum relief  IM  Rapid but slower than IV  IV  Fastest route, PCA  SQ  Intraspinal 23 24 8/5/2024 13 PCA DOSING  Basal Rate: Morphine 2mg/hr  Demand Rate: Morphine 4 mg every 15 minutes.  How many mg per hour will the patient receive if they pushed the PCA button every 15 minutes within the hour??  Who is allowed to push the button?

What would you do? 1. The patient who needs more and more opioid to achieve pain relief. 2. The patient who asks for pain medication before the ordered time interval allows. 3. The patient who continues to take opioids despite harmful effects. 4. The patient who is a “clock watcher.” Which patient is addicted to pain medication? 37 38 8/5/2024 20 When asking the patient if he/she is having pain right now and they say yes, what other questions would you ask? 1.
