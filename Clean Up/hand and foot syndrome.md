Hand-Foot Syndrome, also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ([[PPE]]), is a side effect of certain chemotherapy [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and targeted therapies. It causes redness, swelling, and pain on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. In more severe cases, it can lead to blisters, peeling skin, and even sores.

### Causes:
Hand-Foot Syndrome is most commonly associated with specific chemotherapy [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], including:
- **[[capecitabine]] (Xeloda)**
- **5-[[fluorouracil (5-FU)]] ([[fluorouracil (5-FU)]])**
- **[[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin)**
- **Liposomal [[doxorubicin]] (Doxil)**
- **[[cytarabine (ara-C)]]**
- **[[sunitinib]] (Sutent)**
- **[[sorafenib]] (Nexavar)**

These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] can leak out of capillaries, particularly in the hands and feet, where [[Blood]] vessels are numerous and exposed to pressure and friction. This leakage can cause damage to the tissues, leading to the symptoms of Hand-Foot Syndrome.

### Symptoms:
Symptoms of Hand-Foot Syndrome can range from mild to severe and may include:
- **Redness**: Often similar to a sunburn, affecting the palms and soles.
- **Swelling**: Particularly in the hands and feet.
- **Pain or Tenderness**: A burning or tingling sensation.
- **Blisters**: In more severe cases.
- **Peeling Skin**: The skin may crack or peel, especially if untreated.
- **Sores or Ulcers**: Can develop in severe cases, making walking or using the hands painful.

### Prevention and Management:
While Hand-Foot Syndrome can’t always be prevented, certain steps can help reduce the severity of symptoms:
- **Dose Adjustment**: If symptoms are severe, the oncologist may reduce the dose of the chemotherapy drug or delay treatment.
- **Topical Creams**: Urea-based creams, moisturizing lotions, and corticosteroid creams can help soothe the skin.
- **Cooling**: Applying cold packs or soaking hands and feet in cool water can reduce symptoms.
- **Avoiding Heat and Friction**: Patients should avoid activities that involve heat or excessive rubbing of the hands and feet, such as using hot water, jogging, or walking long distances.
- **Wearing Comfortable Shoes and Gloves**: Reduces pressure and friction on the feet and hands.
- **Pain Relief**: Over-the-counter pain relievers may help manage discomfort.

### When to Seek Medical Attention:
If symptoms become severe or interfere with daily activities, it’s important to contact a healthcare provider. Severe cases of Hand-Foot Syndrome may require more intensive treatment, including stopping chemotherapy temporarily to allow the skin to heal.

### Prognosis:
Hand-Foot Syndrome typically improves once chemotherapy is completed or adjusted. While uncomfortable and sometimes painful, it is usually not life-threatening, but managing symptoms effectively is crucial for maintaining quality of life during cancer treatment.
