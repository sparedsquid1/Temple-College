There are many personality theories but your text book describes four categories or perspectives of personality theory. They are: Psychoanalytic Perspective - emphasizes the importance of the unconscious drives and processes, sexual and aggressive instincts, and early childhood experiences. Humanistic Perspective - emphasizes the self and growth, self-fulfillment, and reaching one's full potential. This is an optimistic or positive view of human nature. 1 Social Cognitive Perspective - emphasizes learning and conscious cognitive processes, including the importance of beliefs about the self, goal setting, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. Trait Perspective - focuses on measuring and describing individual differences. Sigmund Freud, 1856-1939, Austrian, Neurologist • Considered the fother und founder of psychodynamic theory. • He based his theory on observations of his patients (A small group of middle-aged Austrian women.) as well as on self-analysis. • Used cocaine in his therapy sessions. • Freud was the first, in the study of human behavior and the mind, to develop a stage theory of development. Terms associated with Freud's theory: free association, catharsis, ego defense mechanisms, dream interpretation, ego, id, and superego, infantile sexuality, psychosexual stages of development, fixation, libido, Oedipus complex, Electra complex, and Neo-Freudians. Freud wrote extensively applying his theory to all parts of life. Some of his publications include: Studies on Hysteria, 1895, The Interpretation of Dreams, 1900, The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, 1904, Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, 1905.

Carl Jung, 1875-1961, Psychiatrist • A close disciple of Freud, initially. \"Adopted son.\" • Jung rejected the belief that human behavior was fueled by instinctual drives. • Believed that personality continues to develop throughout the lifespan. • Studied different cultures to develop his theory, \"Analytical Psychology.\" 2 Chapter 11 Personality Unconscious Archetypes - Universal memories Archetypes (Carl Jung) Handout 1 Ego Personal Unconscious Personal memories From world leaders to mythic gods to gargantuan sandwiches, the hero represents someone who rises to the occasion to conquer and vanquish with great might. Often the hero is a relatively weak individual, but one who connects to powerful internal forces. This archetype is often seen as a collective shadow figure representing the underdeveloped or inferior traits of individuals. In mythology (such as many Native American folktales) the trickster is often dull-witted but someone who typically provides positive outcomes. The Virgin Mary, the Hindu goddess Kali, fertility symbols, Henry Moore sculptures, \"Mother Earth,\" myths and legends of motherhood ... these are all reflections of our archetype of one who ushers us into existence and nurtures us. Our image and sense of fathers is tied to spirituality. An obvious link, established well before Jung, is found in many Judea-Christian religions. The archetype of order. Examples of this are plentiful both within and across cultures. Circles, squares, fractal forms, swastikas, wheels, yin-yang, crosses, and numbers are a few examples. Journeys to the self, whether in mythology, dreams, or symbols, represent transformation. From Diogenes' search for an honest person to someone's life-altering revelation, transformation plays a role in human development and growth. 3 Chapter 11 Personality Handout 1 Karen Horney, 1885-1952.
