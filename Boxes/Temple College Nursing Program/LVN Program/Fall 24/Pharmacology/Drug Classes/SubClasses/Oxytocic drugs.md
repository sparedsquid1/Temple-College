### Adverse Reactions 
Administration of [[oxytocin]] may result in the following: 
- For the mother 
	- Nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, anaphylactic reactions 
	- Uterine rupture, uterine hypertonicity 
- For the fetus 
	- Bradycardia 

[[oxytocin]] is similar to the hormone [[vasopressin]] and because of its antidiuretic effect, serious water intoxication (fluid overload, fluid volume excess) may occur, particularly when the drug is administered by continuous infusion and the client is receiving fluids by [[Mouth]].

Adverse reactions associated with other uterine stimulants include the following (to the mother): 
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea 
- Elevated [[Blood]] pressure, temporary chest pain 
- Dizziness, water intoxication, headache 

Allergic reactions may also occur. In some instances, hypertension associated with seizure or headache may occur.

### Contraindications
[[oxytocin]] is contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug, cephalopelvic disproportion, and unfavorable fetal position or presentation. It is also contraindicated in obstetric emergencies, situations of fetal distress when delivery is not imminent, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hypertonic [[uterus]], as well as during pregnancy when there is total [[placenta]] previa. It should not be used as an agent to induce labor when vaginal delivery is contraindicated. [[oxytocin]] is not expected to be a risk to the fetus when administered as indicated. When [[oxytocin]] is administered with vasopressors, however, severe maternal hypertension may occur.

[[misoprostol]] should not be prescribed where a spontaneous labor and vaginal delivery would be contraindicated, including women who have had a prior cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery. Precaution in using with clients who have cardiovascular or renal disease. 

[[methylergonovine]] and [[carboprost]] are not used before delivery of the fetus. They are contraindicated in those with known hypersensitivity to the drug or hypertension. These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are used cautiously in clients with [[Heart]] disease, vascular disease with narrowed vessels, and renal or hepatic disease, and during lactation. When [[methylergonovine]] is administered concurrently with vasopressors or to clients who are heavy cigarette smokers, excessive vasoconstriction may occur.
