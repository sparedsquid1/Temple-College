**H&H** refers to **Hemoglobin (Hb)** and **Hematocrit (Hct)**, two important measurements in a complete [[Blood]] count (CBC) that help assess a person's overall [[Blood]] health.

### 1. **Hemoglobin (Hb)**:
- **Definition**: A protein in red [[Blood]] cells responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returning carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
- **Normal ranges**:
  - For adult males: 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL).
  - For adult females: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL.
- **Significance**: Low hemoglobin levels can indicate anemia, while high levels might suggest dehydration or a disorder such as polycythemia.

### 2. **Hematocrit (Hct)**:
- **Definition**: The percentage of red [[Blood]] cells in the total [[Blood]] volume.
- **Normal ranges**:
  - For adult males: 40.7% to 50.3%.
  - For adult females: 36.1% to 44.3%.
- **Significance**: A low hematocrit value also suggests anemia, while elevated levels may indicate dehydration or conditions causing an increase in red [[Blood]] cell production.

### Clinical Relevance:
- **Anemia**: Both low hemoglobin and hematocrit values are often used to diagnose and assess the severity of anemia.
- **Dehydration**: Elevated H&H values may indicate dehydration.
- **Polycythemia**: Increased levels may suggest an overproduction of red [[Blood]] cells.

H&H values are commonly used to evaluate [[Blood]] disorders and overall health in routine check-ups, pre-surgery evaluations, and for monitoring certain medical conditions.
