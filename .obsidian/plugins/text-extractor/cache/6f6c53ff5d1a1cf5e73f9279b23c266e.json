Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Answer Section MULTIPLE CHOICE 1. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe the signs and symptoms of each of the common STIs. Page: 920 Heading: Vulvovaginitis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 A thin watery vaginal discharge does not support the presence of vulvovaginitis. 2 A patient can have vulvovaginitis with or without sexual contact. A variety of sexually and nonsexually transmitted infectious agents can cause vulvovaginitis. 3 Bartholin glands can develop abscesses as a result of infection with nonsexually transmitted microbes or STIs such as gonorrhea and Chlamydia. 4 Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite can present for a variety of reasons and is not a manifestation exclusively of vulvovaginitis. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 2. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Plan teaching to promote STI prevention. Page: 920 Heading: Human Papillomavirus Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Being vaccinated with Gardasil before the age of 15 years does not protect the patient against all types of high- and low-risk HPVs. The patient needs this information, but it is not the greatest need. 2 High-risk HPV can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women. Men can develop cancer of the penis. Both genders are at risk for anal and oropharyngeal cancers. This is the greatest need for information for this patient. 3 The Gardasil vaccine is effective in two doses if they are received before the age Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company of 15; after 15, three doses are required. There is no need for additional information. 4 The patient is correct about still being at risk for types of HPV. Additional information may be helpful, but it is not the greatest need for this patient. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 3. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe the signs and symptoms of each of the common STIs. Page: 921 Heading: Chlamydia Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Painful urination is a concern, but is not as health threatening as liver inflammation. 2 Conjunctivitis is a concern but is not as health threatening as liver inflammation. 3 Vaginal discharge is a concern but is not as health threatening as liver inflammation. 4 Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, a surface inflammation of the liver, can also be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. This inflammation may cause nausea, vomiting, and sharp pain at the base of the ribs that sometimes refers to the right shoulder and arm. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 4. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe the signs and symptoms of each of the common STIs. Page: 920 Heading: Urethritis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Female partners of men with urethritis can also exhibit the symptoms of urethritis. This information supports the diagnosis. 2 Urethritis is caused by a variety of microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, and herpes simplex virus. These are all microorganisms that Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company are sexually transmitted. The patient is not likely to become infected by swimming in a river. 3 Urethritis can also cause epididymitis in the male patient, which accounts for tenderness on the testicles. The lack of genital tenderness may or may not support the diagnosis. 4 The patient’s statement about drinking cranberry juice does not support urethritis. The patient suspected and responded to a possible bladder infection. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 5. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe the signs and symptoms of each of the common STIs. Page: 920 Heading: Genital Ulcers Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 It is expected for a patient admitted with pneumonia to experience shortness of breath and coughing. 2 It is not unexpected for a patient admitted with pneumonia to have a poor intake of food and liquids. The nurse will encourage intake as tolerated. 3 The nurse will report the presence of an open ulcer on the patient’s penis immediately to the RN or HCP. Genital ulcers can be caused by syphilis, herpes, and HIV. The absence of pain is most indicative of a syphilic ulcer. 4 Because of the poor fluid intake, it is expected that the patient may have a low urinary output. However, the nurse will monitor this finding carefully. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 6. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Identify the pathogens involved with each of the common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Page: 928 Heading: Hepatitis B Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 2 Eye medication may be necessary for gonorrhea or Chlamydia. 3 The infant needs to receive the HBV vaccination. 4 It is recommended that all babies of HBV-positive mothers receive HBV immune globulin less than 12 hours after birth and then be immunized with HBV vaccine 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months after birth. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 7. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Explain how you will know whether your nursing interventions have been effective. Page: 926 Heading: Herpes Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is more serious than HSV-I. 2 Nursing teaching has been effective if the patient understands that an active lesion close to the time of birth will result in a cesarean section. 3 Babies born to women with genital herpes always carry a risk for skin, eye, mucous membrane, and nervous system involvement. If the newborn develops a disseminated herpes infection, it can be life threatening. 4 If the patient declines prophylactic antiviral medications at 36 weeks gestation, teaching has not been effective. The patient needs to know that medication at this point in pregnancy will not cause birth defects. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 8. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe the signs and symptoms of each of the common STIs. Page: 925 Heading: Syphilis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient may be exhibiting manifestations of secondary syphilis. Inquiring about unprotected sex may provide a source of an STI, but the nurse needs additional information before drawing any conclusions about the patient’s condition. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 2 The initial sign of syphilis is a painless, red, ulcerated area called a chancre, which can appear anywhere on the patient’s body. Chancres are the only manifestation of the primary stage of syphilis. This question is most important in determining if the patient is experiencing the secondary stage of syphilis. 3 During the secondary stage of syphilis, the hair may thin; however, this is not a manifestation specific to syphilis. 4 Joint pain may occur during the second stage of syphilis; however, this is not a manifestation specific to syphilis. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 9. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Describe treatment options for common STIs. Page: 927 Heading: Genital Warts (Low-Risk HPV) Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Cryotherapy is a safe treatment of genital warts during pregnancy. The freezing of the wart is performed by touching it with a cryoprobe or with a liquid-nitrogen soaked swab. 2 Immunity stimulation treatment is not considered safe during pregnancy. The therapy uses medications to manipulate the patient’s immunity system into attacking the virus. The cytotoxic effects can damage the fetus. 3 Laser treatment on genital warts is safe during pregnancy. The laser causes destruction of the wart tissue. 4 Electrocautery is a safe treatment of genital warts during pregnancy. The process produces heat that causes proteins to coagulate, resulting in death of the wart tissue. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 10. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 44.

Page: 928 Heading: Genital Parasites Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Feedback 1 Permethrin is a topical medication used for the treatment of scabies, not pubic lice. All medications for scabies or pubic lice are topical. 2 The lack of new red tracts under the skin is an indication that the patient does not have scabies. Resolution of pulic lice is supported by a lack of itching, redness, or visualization of the parasites. 3 The patient needs to understand that pubic lice or scabies are not true STIs. 4 Teaching is determined to be effective when the patient states a new cautious attitude about sexual partners. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 11. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Plan nursing care for patients with STIs. Page: 920 Heading: Gerontological Issues Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The nurse needs to immediately inform the RN, who will ask for permission to perform a physical examination. 2 Before asking if the male forced the female to have sex, data must be gathered to support or rule out the event. It is possible that geriatric residents may have consensual sex. 3 If the female exhibits the manifestations indicative of an STI, the male will need to be tested. Older adults who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors are also at risk for STIs. However, the situation must be validated. 4 It states in the question that the female resident is oriented. The nurse needs to understand that older adults may have consensual sex. However, the condition of the female must be assessed. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 12. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 44.

Page: 921 Heading: Gonorrhea Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Comprehension (Understanding) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Feedback 1 Gonorrhea is treatable with antibiotics, which have side effects, but not such serious side effects that compliance is affected. 2 Men may be asymptomatic or may have urethritis with a yellow urethral discharge. 3 Women who have gonorrhea may have either no noticeable symptoms or have a sore throat, mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC), urethritis, or abnormal menstrual symptoms such as bleeding between periods. 4 The antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea do not have side effects so serious that compliance is affected. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 13. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44.

Page: 920 Heading: Mucopurulent Cervicitis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 MPC is not caused by an imbalance of the vaginal flora. 2 MPC is caused by the same organisms that cause urethritis. Some causative agents include N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, U urealyticum, T vaginalis, C albicans, and herpes simplex virus, which are associated with STIs. 3 Needing or receiving antibiotics during gestation does not cause MPC. 4 Sexual activity during pregnancy, either prolonged absence or frequent activity, does not cause MPC.

Page: 920 Heading: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Feedback 1 It is extremely important for the patient with PID to complete both the IV and oral antibiotics regimens to cure the infection. When the patient states an understanding, teaching is considered successful. Compliance is evaluated later. 2 The patient may be upset about the possibility of infertility, but without a specific plan, the nurse cannot be certain the information has been effective. 3 Asking about surgery to restore fertility does not indicate that information has been effective. The patient is seeking a resolution and not deciding on a change. 4 Becoming monogamous may or may not indicate the information was effective. A promise to change is not an indicator of change. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 15. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 44. Nursing Care of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Objective: Identify the pathogens involved with each of the common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Page: 928 Heading: Cellular Changes Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Cellular changes can be related to STIs and result in precancerous or cancerous changes. Herpes viruses, HIV, and human papilloma have all been linked to the development of cancer. Proctitis is especially prevalent among persons who engage in anal intercourse. 2 The patient may or may not have a family history of gastrointestinal cancer. Given the patient’s medical history, proctitis is the most likely cause. 3 There is no information regarding medical advice given to the patient by the HCP. 4 Dietary and vitamin therapy are not always the best preventions of cancer; the patient has a history of a precancerous or cancerous condition related to cellular changes caused by inflammation.

A. Davis Company Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Cystic ovaries are not diagnosed from pain during a bimanual examination. 2 An ectopic pregnancy is not diagnosed from pain during a bimanual examination. 3 PID can be asymptomatic until the performance of a bimanual examination, which causes pain. 4 MPC is not diagnosed from pain during a bimanual examination. It may produce mucopurulent yellow exudate on the cervix or be asymptomatic. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 17. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 44.

Page: 920 Heading: Nursing Care Tip Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Infection Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Probing about the identity of the “friend” may keep the teenager from getting needed advice. 2 With or without symptoms, the nurse should encourage medical care. It is not within the nurse’s scope of practice to diagnose a condition. 3 The nurse needs to make sure the teenage friend gets appropriate help. Offering to approach the teenager’s mother may interfere with getting medical help. 4 It is most important for the nurse to explain why the teenager needs to seek medical attention for a possible STI. The nurse’s goal is to provide information and encourage early treatment to prevent complications. PTS: 1 CON: Infection 18. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 44.

A. Davis Company Feedback 1 Teaching can be valuable for future reference; just because the student is not sexually active does not mean that teaching is ineffective. 2 The prevention of STIs has nothing to do with how a boyfriend feels; the desire to have sex can prompt irresponsible behaviors. This comment indicates that teaching is ineffective for this student. 3 Understanding and voicing the seriousness of an STI indicate that teaching has been effective. 4 Teaching is effective if the student is aware of available resources, and how and where they can be accessed.
