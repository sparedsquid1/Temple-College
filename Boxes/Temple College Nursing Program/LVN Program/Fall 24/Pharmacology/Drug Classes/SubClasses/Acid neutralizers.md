### Adverse Reactions 
Antacids can have unpleasant reactions on the lower GI system producing either diarrhea or constipation. The [[magnesium]]- and sodium-containing antacids may have a laxative effect and may produce diarrhea. Aluminum- and calcium-containing products tend to produce constipation. Although the antacids have the potential for serious adverse reactions, they have a wide margin of safety, especially when used as prescribed. Adverse reactions of concern include: 
- Aluminum-containing antacids— constipation, intestinal impaction, anorexia, weakness, tremors, and bone pain 
- [[magnesium]]-containing antacids— severe diarrhea, dehydration, and hypermagnesemia (nausea, vomiting, hypotension, decreased respirations) 
- Calcium-containing antacids— rebound hyperacidity, metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia, vomiting, confusion, headache, renal calculi, and neurologic impairment 
- Sodium bicarbonate— systemic alkalosis and rebound hyperacidity

### Contraindications
The antacids are contraindicated in clients with severe abdominal pain of unknown cause and during lactation. Sodium-containing antacids are contraindicated in clients with cardiovascular problems, such as hypertension or [[Heart]] failure, and those on sodium-restricted diets. Calcium-containing antacids are contraindicated in clients with renal
calculi or hypercalcemia. Aluminum-containing antacids are used cautiously in clients with gastric outlet obstruction or those with upper GI bleeding. [[magnesium]]- and aluminum-containing antacids are used cautiously in clients with decreased kidney function. The calcium-containing antacids are used cautiously in clients with [[Respiratory]] insufficiency, renal impairment, or cardiac disease. Antacids are classified as [[Preg Cat C]] [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and should be used with caution during pregnancy.
