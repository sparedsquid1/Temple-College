A nurse is performing discharge teaching for a client who is prescribed ibuprofen. After teaching the client about the possible cardiovascular effects of the drug, the nurse determines that additional teaching is needed when the client states which comment? A) “My blood pressure may increase.” B) “My blood pressure won't change.” C) “I could develop congestive heart failure.” D) “I could experience a heart attack.” Answer: B Rationale: The client should be counseled that NSAIDs including ibuprofen may result in the following cardiovascular effects: increased or decreased blood pressure, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 14 Learning Objective: 7 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 177, Cardiovascular System Reactions 2. A nurse is preparing a presentation for a local community group about over-the-counter analgesics, including NSAIDs. Which possible reaction would the nurse integrate into the presentation as a serious risk with this class of drugs? A) Increased granulocyte count B) Cardiovascular thrombosis C) Increased WBC count D) Sickle cell anemia Answer: B Rationale: A serious risk involved with the use of NSAIDs is cardiovascular thrombosis. Increased granulocyte count, increased WBC count, or sickle cell anemia is not caused by NSAIDs. Sickle cell anemia results from an inherited abnormality of hemoglobin. NSAIDs may cause decreased granulocyte count, decreased WBC count, or aplastic anemia.

A nurse is preparing a discharge teaching for a client who is to continue taking NSAIDs at home. Which important point should the nurse prioritize in the teaching? A) Take aspirin if necessary strictly with a full glass of water. B) Use the drug on a very regular basis during treatment. C) Call your health care provider if you have no relief after 2 weeks. D) Take the drugs strictly with a glass of milk or juice. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to consult the primary health care provider if the pain, swelling, inflammation, or tenderness is not relieved after 2 weeks. The drug takes several days to relieve the discomfort, so it is important for the client to give the drug time to work. The nurse should instruct the client to avoid the use of aspirin. The drug should be taken with a full glass of water or with food. It is not necessary to take NSAIDs strictly with a glass of juice or milk. These drugs are not to be used on a regular basis unless the client is strictly instructed to do so by the primary health care provider.

A nurse caring for a client who is receiving an NSAID for fever reduction documents a decrease in urinary output for the client. Which event would the nurse most likely determine as the reason for the client's condition? A) Prolonged immobility B) Reduced intake of fibrous food C) Intake of food with antacids D) Prolonged temperature elevation Answer: D Rationale: If temperature elevation is prolonged while on NSAID therapy, hot, dry, flushed skin and a decrease in urinary output may develop; consequently, dehydration can occur. Prolonged immobility, reduced intake of fibrous food, and intake of food with antacids should not cause a decrease in urinary output.

A client with controlled hypertension asks about using an over-the-counter NSAID for muscle aches. What is the best response from the nurse when describing the possible effect of mixing the two drugs? A) Can increase the metabolism of the antihypertensive drug B) Can increase absorption of the antihypertensive drug C) Can decrease the effectiveness of the antihypertensive drug D) Can decrease the metabolism of NSAIDs Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should inform the client that taking an NSAID while on antihypertensive drug therapy decreases the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs. Interactions of NSAIDs and antihypertensive drugs do not include increased metabolism of antihypertensive drugs, increased absorption of antihypertensive drugs, or decreased metabolism of NSAIDs.

After teaching a client about the prescribed NSAID therapy, the nurse determines that the teaching was successful when the client states which comment? A) “I will take the drug with high-fiber foods.” B) “I need to take the drug on an empty stomach.” C) “I should take the drug with food and milk. D) “I need to take it with a calcium supplement.” Answer: C Rationale: The client should take the drug with food and milk to promote an optimal response to NSAID therapy; this helps minimize the risk of GI effects. The client does not need to take an NSAID with fiber-rich food or with calcium supplements. He should not take it on an empty stomach.

A 60-year-old client with rheumatoid arthritis reveals to the nurse the recent use of an OTC NSAID. The nurse should point out the client is at an increased risk for developing which disorder related to the use of NSAIDs? A) Ulcer disease B) CNS disorders C) Hearing impairment D) Blindness Answer: A Rationale: Age appears to increase the possibility of adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk of serious ulcer disease in adults older than 65 years is increased with higher doses of NSAIDs. CNS disorders, hearing impairment, and blindness are not effects associated with using NSAIDs on a long-term basis in older clients.
