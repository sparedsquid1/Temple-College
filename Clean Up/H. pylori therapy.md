**[[H. pylori]] therapy** refers to the medical treatment aimed at eradicating *[[H. pylori]]* ([[H. pylori]]), a bacterium that infects the stomach lining and is associated with various gastrointestinal conditions, including peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, and an increased risk of gastric cancer.

### Goals of H. pylori Therapy
The primary goals of treating [[H. pylori]] infection are to:

1. **Eliminate the infection** to prevent recurrence of ulcers or gastritis.
2. **Promote healing** of the stomach and duodenal lining.
3. **Prevent complications** such as peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and MALT [[Lymphoma]] (a type of stomach [[Lymphoma]]).

### Standard Treatment Regimens
The treatment of [[H. pylori]] typically involves a combination of antibiotics and acid-suppressing medications. The most common regimens include:

1. **Triple Therapy:**
   - **Two antibiotics:** Common choices include [[clarithromycin]] and [[amoxicillin]], or [[metronidazole]] if the patient is allergic to penicillin.
   - **Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI):** Such as [[omeprazole]], [[esomeprazole]], or [[lansoprazole]], which reduce stomach acid production and help the antibiotics work more effectively.

   **Duration:** Usually 10 to 14 days.

2. **Quadruple Therapy:**
   - **Two antibiotics:** Common choices are [[tetracycline]] and [[metronidazole]].
   - **Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI):** To reduce stomach acid.
   - **[[Bismuth]] Subsalicylate:** Often included to protect the stomach lining and enhance the eradication of [[H. pylori]].

   **Duration:** Typically 10 to 14 days.

   Quadruple therapy is often used in cases of antibiotic resistance, previous treatment failure, or in areas with high [[clarithromycin]] resistance.

3. **[[levofloxacin]]-based Therapy:**
   - **[[levofloxacin]]** is used as an alternative antibiotic in combination with [[amoxicillin]] and a PPI, especially when first-line therapies fail or in areas with high resistance rates to [[clarithromycin]].

   **Duration:** Usually 10 to 14 days.

### Follow-up and Testing for Eradication
- **Post-Treatment Testing:** It is important to confirm the eradication of [[H. pylori]] after completing therapy. This is usually done with a non-invasive test, such as a urea breath test, stool antigen test, or less commonly, an endoscopic biopsy. Testing is typically performed at least four weeks after completing the antibiotics and two weeks after stopping the PPI to avoid false-negative results.
  
- **Retreatment:** If the initial treatment fails, a different combination of antibiotics (typically quadruple therapy or a [[levofloxacin]]-based regimen) is used. Retesting after retreatment is also recommended.

### Challenges in H. pylori Therapy
- **Antibiotic Resistance:** Rising resistance to antibiotics, particularly [[clarithromycin]] and [[metronidazole]], can reduce the effectiveness of standard regimens, making it important to select appropriate therapy based on local resistance patterns and patient history.
- **Side Effects:** Common side effects of therapy include gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea, taste changes), which can affect adherence to treatment.
- **Patient Compliance:** Completing the full course of therapy as prescribed is crucial for successful eradication, as incomplete treatment can lead to resistance and treatment failure.

### Adjunctive Measures
- **Probiotics:** Some studies suggest that probiotics, such as *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium*, may help reduce side effects of therapy and improve eradication rates by maintaining gut flora balance.
- **Diet and Lifestyle:** While not a primary treatment, dietary changes, such as avoiding spicy foods, [[caffeine]], and [[Alcohol]], can help manage symptoms during treatment.

Effective eradication of [[H. pylori]] is crucial for preventing complications and ensuring long-term gastrointestinal health. Treatment regimens should be tailored to the patient's individual needs, taking into account factors like antibiotic resistance, previous treatment history, and potential side effects.
