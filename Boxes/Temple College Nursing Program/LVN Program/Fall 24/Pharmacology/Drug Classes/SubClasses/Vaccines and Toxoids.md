### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions from the administration of [[Vaccines]] or toxoids are usually mild. Chills, [[Fever]], muscular aches and pains, rash, and lethargy may be present. Pain and tenderness at the injection site may also occur. Although rare, a hypersensitivity reaction may occur. Some people concerned with egg allergies have refused vaccination. For these individuals, many of the routine [[Vaccines]], such as the yearly influenza vaccine, have an alternative preparation that is not made with eggs. The Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents provides a listing of the typical adverse reactions. 

### Contraindications
Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the agent or any component of it. Allergy to eggs is a concern with some [[Vaccines]]. It is recommended to see a primary health care provider familiar with egg allergies for vaccination if an allergy is suspected. Some people with “hive-only” reactions are able to tolerate [[Vaccines]] without a problem (ACIP, 2012). The measles, mumps, rubella, and [[varicella]] [[Vaccines]] are contraindicated in clients who have had an allergic reaction to gelatin, [[neomycin]], or a previous dose of one of the [[Vaccines]]. The measles, mumps, rubella, and [[varicella]] [[Vaccines]] are contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first [[trimester]], because of the danger of birth defects. Women are instructed to avoid becoming pregnant at least 3 months after receiving these [[Vaccines]]. [[Vaccines]] and toxoids are contraindicated during acute febrile illnesses, [[Leukemia]], [[Lymphoma]], immunosuppressive illness or drug therapy, and nonlocalized cancer. Always ask about allergy history before preparing a vaccine for administration. See [[Box 47.5]] for additional information on the contraindications to immunologic agents.
