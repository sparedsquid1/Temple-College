If the gastric residual is greater than 500 mL (or per agency policy), replace the residual, document and notify the registered nurse (RN) or primary care provider, and delay the next feeding for the interval specified by agency policy. * Perform fingerstick for blood glucose every 4 to 6 hours as ordered for hyperglycemia until the patient demonstrates a normal blood glucose level. * [f nausea occurs, stop the feeding and notify the primary care provider. * Maintain an accurate intake and output record. Dehydration can occur because of diarrhea or the high glucose content of the formula. * [f persistent diarrhea occurs, notify the primary care provider. ‘Williams, P: deWit’s Fundamental Concept and Skills for Nursing, 6% ed, St Louis, 2021, Elsevier","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
