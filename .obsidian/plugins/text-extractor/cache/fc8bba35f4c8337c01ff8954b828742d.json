List the routes used for administering parenteral medications and the advantages and disadvantages of each route for pediatric, adult, and older adult patients. Describe how to aseptically and accurately withdraw, measure and/or combine the ordered dose of a medication from a vial or ampule. Discuss reconstitution of a medication from a powder. What is Parental? • NOT via the gastrointestinal tract • Requires use of syringe and needle • Intravenous catheter Medication delivered... Introduces mediation into the body tissues or fluids. Must be sterile! Parental Injections ◦ Often necessary to inject medication into tissue. ◦ Injections cause pain. ◦ Make student nurses uncomfortable; causes patient discomfort. ◦ Students need to learn & practice this skill This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY. Principles of Parenteral Injections Select • Patient is NPO • Digestion counteracts absorption • Hasten action of drug Always: • Ensure accurate dose • Select the correct site • Use sterile equipment Use • Sterile needles & syringes • Appropriate-length needle Select • Injection site carefully • Rotate sites • Site is • Relatively free of hair • Lesions • Inflammation • Rashes • Moles • Tattoos • Freckles Units for Insulin!!! ML or CC in routine syringes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICJYr-0VlrA Needle Gauges ◦ Available in sizes from 13 to 30 Gauges ◦ Larger the number = the smaller the diameter ◦ 25 - 27, 29 gauge = Intradermal injections ◦ 25 - 27 gauge = Subcutaneous injections ◦ 21 - 23 gauge = Intramuscular injections Large Medium Small Smaller or larger? 26 G versus 18 G? 20 G versus 24 G? 16 G versus 27 G? Needle Length Dependent on tissue to reach 5/8 to ½ inch: intradermal and subcutaneous 1 inch to 3 inches for intramuscular Intradermal & SQ IM Bevel Up!! Angle Matters! Needle Sticks ◦ HIV, Hepatitis B and C can be spread by a needle stick from an infected patient. ◦ Safety syringes are available and should be used ◦ Report all needle sticks ◦ Immediately dispose of needles after use in Sharps Container!SAFETY-USE ONE-HAND TECHNIQUE FOR RECAPPING NEEDLES One-Hand Recapping Needle Technique ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeAo2jCJjw Cleaning the Injection Site Open alcohol swab Cleanse selected site gently Use circular motion until area approximately 2 inches in diameter is clean Allow skin to dry Vigorous rubbing increases blood flow and increases the rapidity of absorption Pulling Medication-Vial ◦ Small bottle with rubber stopper ◦ Attached by metal band ◦ Volume 1 to 50 ml ◦ May contain single use or multi-use medication ◦ Always inject an amount of AIR into the vial equal to medication to be withdrawn ◦ May be in powder form ◦ Requires reconstitution ◦ Before mixing 2 medications in syringe ◦ ALWAYS CHECK FOR COMPATIBILITY This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Withdrawing Medication from Vial ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjTa2UHQons Route-Intradermal ◦ Med is deposited into the dermal layer ◦ Used for TB skin and allergy testing, plastic surgery ◦ Forms a skin bleb or small bump ◦ Do NOT aspirate or massage area ◦ Produces small wheal (raised area) ◦ If wheal does not appear...good possibility drug entered subcutaneous tissue and test result is considered inaccurate Intradermal ◦ Volume ◦ 0.1-0.5 mL volume ◦ Sites ◦ Inner part of forearm ◦ Upper back ◦ Avoid areas with ◦ Hair ◦ Moles ◦ Scars ◦ Pigmented skin ◦ Syringe ◦ 1-ml syringe (Tuberculin) ◦ 25, 27 gauge ◦ ¼ to 5/8 inch length ◦ Angle ◦ 5-15 degree angle between upper layers of skin Intradermal Injection ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i6YNqizxwk Route-Subcutaneous ◦ Volume ◦ 0.5-1.0 mL volume ◦ Sites ◦ Upper outer arm ◦ Anterior surface of thigh ◦ 2 inches away from umbilicus on abdomen ◦ Needle Gauges ◦ 25 gauge 5/8 inch ◦ 27gauge needle, ⅜ - to ½ inch ◦ Syringe ◦ 1ml (Tuberculin) ◦ 3 mL syringe ◦ Angle ◦ A 45- or 90-degree angle ◦ Dependent on size of needle SQ VOLUME PER SITE SQ NEEDLE GAUGE SQ NEEDLE LENGTH 0.5- 1ML 25-30 3/8, 5/8, 1/2 SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF HEPARIN Administering Subcutaneous Injections ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfP1yZevi1c Route-Intramuscular ◦ Volume ◦ 0.5 to 3 ml ◦ Sites ◦ Deltoid ◦ Ventrogluteal-considered the most comfortable site ◦ Vastus Lateralis-best for infant injections ◦ Needle Gauges ◦ 22-to 23 gauge ◦ 1 to-3 inches; most common 1 to 2 inches ◦ Syringe ◦ 3 to 5 mL syringe ◦ Angle ◦ 90-degree angle ◦ Technique ◦ Aspirate by pulling back the plunger! ◦ Z-track!

A new needle is used for injection. Filter Needles ◦ Meds drawn from an ampule may contain glass ◦ Filter needles ◦ Used to withdraw meds from an ampule to trap the glass particles ◦ Filter is discarded...New needle is attached to the syringe before injection Drawing Up Short and Long Acting Insulins ◦ Step 1 ◦ Inject air into LONGER-acting insulin (CLOUDY!) ◦ Step 2 ◦ Inject air into SHORT-acting insulin (CLEAR!) ◦ Step 3 ◦ Withdraw amount of SHORT-acting insulin (CLEAR!) ◦ Step 4 ◦ Withdraw amount of LONG-acting insulin (CLOUDY!) ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIYcAy6P-hE Flexpens for Insulin Administration ◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qtdweVsdHc Incompatibility of Medications ◦ If medications are incompatible ◦ Color of medication may change ◦ Precipitation may occur ◦ Clouding may occur ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK NURSING PROCESS- ASSESSMENT NURSING PROCESS- NURSING DIAGNOSIS NURSING PROCESS- PLANNING & IMPLEMENTATION THINGS TO REMEMBER","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
