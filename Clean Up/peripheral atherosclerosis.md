Peripheral [[Atherosclerosis]], also known as peripheral artery disease (PAD), is a condition in which the arteries that supply [[Blood]] to the limbs, typically the legs, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of fatty deposits, known as plaques. This buildup of plaques, which is a process called [[Atherosclerosis]], reduces [[Blood]] [[flow]] to the affected areas.

### Key Points about Peripheral Atherosclerosis:

- **Causes**: The primary cause is [[Atherosclerosis]], which involves the accumulation of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin in the inner lining of an artery. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, high [[Blood]] pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.

- **Symptoms**: Many people with PAD are asymptomatic. However, common symptoms include leg pain or cramping ([[claudication]]) during activities like walking, numbness or weakness in the legs, coldness in the lower leg or foot, sores on toes, feet, or legs that won't heal, and a change in the color of the legs.

- **Diagnosis**: PAD can be diagnosed through physical examinations, [[Blood]] tests, and imaging tests such as [[ultrasound]], angiography, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) tests.

- **Complications**: If left untreated, PAD can lead to severe complications such as critical limb [[ischemia]] (severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously decreases [[Blood]] [[flow]] to the extremities), [[Heart]] attack, stroke, and in severe cases, amputation.

- **Treatment**: Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, preventing progression of the disease, and reducing the risk of complications. This can include lifestyle changes (such as quitting smoking, exercising, and adopting a healthy diet), medications (to manage symptoms and prevent [[Blood]] clots), and in some cases, surgical procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery to restore [[Blood]] [[flow]].

Peripheral [[Atherosclerosis]] is a serious condition that requires medical attention to manage and reduce the risk of severe outcomes.
