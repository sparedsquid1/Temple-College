Nursing Skills Niomi Quinteros BSN, RN Introduction Infection Prevention and Control 1 2 5/18/2024 2 Infection An infection is the entry of an infectious agent, a microorganism (organism only visible with a microscope), into the body that multiplies and disrupts tissue integrity • Pathogens: microorganisms capable of causing disease • Nonpathogenic organism (Normal Flora) • Some microorganisms produce toxins and others release endotoxins • Infection my result in illness and disease Infectious Agents • Bacteria • Prions • Protozoa • Viruses • Rickettsia • Fungi • Helminths • Others- Mycoplasmas, Chlamydia Go to fullsize image Go to fullsize image Go to fullsize image 3 4 5/18/2024 3 Bacteria • Single-celled microorganisms lacking a nucleus • Reproduce every few minutes up to several weeks • Classified according to need for oxygen, shape, and gram staining • Oxygen • Aerobic need oxygen to grow and thrive • Anaerobic grow only when oxygen is not present • Shape • Cocci, bacilli, spirochetes • Gram-stain • Gram positive • Gram negative • More dangerous • May produce endotoxins that can cause hemorrhagic shock Bacteria • Treatment/Nursing Care • Antibiotics • Culture and Sensitivity Test • Wash hands/alcohol-based rub • Patient education for prevention • Keep any healing cut or abrasion clean and covered • Avoid sharing personal items such as razors, towels, and makeup • Avoid contact with other people’s bandages or wounds 5 6 5/18/2024 4 Bacteria • Multidrug-resistant organisms • Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) • Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) • Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) • Clostridium Difficile (C.diff) • Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia Prions • Protein particles that lack nucleic acids • Usual methods to destroy bacteria or viruses do not work • Do not trigger an immune response • Causes degenerative neurologic disease • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a human version of mad cow disease) 7 8 5/18/2024 5 Protozoa • One cell organism • Can be pathogenic to humans • Malaria • Dysentery • Other strains capable to causing diarrhea Viruses • Extremely small and can only be seen with an electron microscope • Composed of particles of nucleic acids, either DNA or RNA, with a protein coat • Can grow and replicate only within a living cell 9 10 5/18/2024 6 Rickettsia • Small round or rod-shaped organism • Transmitted by the bites of lice, ticks, fleas, and mites • Multiply only in host cells • Causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus Fungi • Contain no chlorophyll • Examples include yeasts or molds • Thrive in moist environments • Reproduce by spores • Fungal infections in humans are called mycoses 11 12 5/18/2024 7 Helminths • Parasitic worms or flukes • Pinworms, mostly affect children, are the most common worldwide • Roundworms and tapeworms Other Infectious Agents • Mycoplasmas • Very small organisms without a cell wall • Cause infections of respiratory or genital tract • Example: Mycoplasma pneumoniae • Chlamydia • Affects the genitourinary and reproductive tracts • Increasingly more common in the past 20 years 13 14 5/18/2024 8 Process (Chain) of Infection Causative Agent (Link One) • Any microorganism or biologic agent capable of causing disease • Some are more virulent than others • 4 stages of infection • Incubation • Prodrome • Illness • Convalescence • Ways to remove this link from the chain • Disinfection • Sterilization 15 16 5/18/2024 9 Reservoir • Places where microorganisms are found • Infected wounds • Human or animal waste • Animals and insects • Contaminated food and water • Person with an infection • Ways to remove this link from the chain • Standard precaution • Good hand hygiene • Use of sterile technique when appropriate Portal of Exit • The route where the pathogen leaves the host • Gastrointestinal tract • Respiratory tract • Skin/mucous membranes • Blood • Ways to remove this link from the chain • Identify and treat the infected person • Isolation techniques and barrier precautions 17 18 5/18/2024 10 Mode of Transfer • Direct contact (most common route to spread microorganisms) • Indirect contact (Formite) • Vectors • Droplet • Spread from one part of the body to another • Ways to remove this link from the chain • Effective hand hygiene • Proper disinfection and sterilization • Use of surgical and medical aseptic technique • Standard precautions • Education • Controlling insects • Filtering air Portal of Entry • The route where the pathogen enters the host • Mucous membranes • Consuming contaminated food or water • Breathing droplets containing pathogens • Broken skin (usually non-intact) • Ways to remove this link of the chain • Use sterile or clean items • Barrier precautions • Safe handling of food or water • Good personal hygiene • Avoid high risk behaviors • Protect from insect bites 19 20 5/18/2024 11 Susceptible Host • A human host may be susceptible by virtue of age, state of health, or broken skin • Factors • Poor nutrition • Inadequate hygiene • Impaired mobility • Chronic illness • Physiologic changes • Ways to remove this link of the chain • Good health and hygiene habits • Immunizations • Aseptic techniques, barrier precautions, and protective isolation • Proper nutrition • Adequate sleep • Decreased stress 21 22 5/18/2024 12 Body Defenses Against Infection • First line of defense • Second line of defense • Third line of defense Primary Defense • Skin • Intact • Sebaceous glands – limit growth • Mucous membranes • Lysozymes (bacteriocidal) • Eyes (tears), respiratory, reproductive tracts • Cilia • Stomach • Hydrochloric acid • Liver • Kupffer cells • Detoxifies toxic chemicals • Intestines • Feces flushes out bacteria • Urine • pH prevents infection • Flushes out bacteria 23 24 5/18/2024 13 Second Line of Defense When the 1st line of defense fails • Fever – Temperature of 101 F or higher slows growth or kills many pathogens • Fever is the body’s way of creating an environment that is harmful to germs • Leukocytosis – Increases WBC’s (The normal number of WBCs in the blood is 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs) • Phagocytosis – (Macrophages) • Inflammation • Interferon - Antiviral Defense Mechanisms • Leukocytes/Macrophages • Neutrophils • Monocytes • Lymphocytes • Basophils • Eosinophils • WBC & Differential Count • Used to determine what kind of infection (bacterial, viral, or parasitic) 25 26 5/18/2024 14 Inflammatory Response (2nd Line of Defense) • Inflammatory response occurs from any injury (mechanical, chemical, infection) • Blood Vessels Dilate – Blood rushes to area • Dilation causes redness, warmth & edema. Increase WBCs at the site of injury • Histamine and Serotonin – causes capillary walls to be more permeable • Fibrinogen - promotes clotting & walls off area • Pus – purulent drainage made up of WBCs and debris Inflammatory Response • Inflammatory response • Signs include: • Redness • Warmth • Edema • Purposes • Neutralize and destroy harmful agents • Limit their spread to other tissues in the body • Prepare the damaged tissues for repair 27 28 5/18/2024 15 Third Line of Defense • Immune response – the body’s reaction to substances not its own • Leukocytes & Macrophages localize • Antibodies attack • Antigen-antibody response • Antigens are found on surfaces of certain cells • Are specific to a certain microorganism • Once a person is exposed to a specific antigen, antibodies are made to prevent future infections • Immunoglobulins • Contain antibodies • Can come from another person or animal • Often injected into patients who need immediate protection from an organism Lines of Defense Types of Immunity • Naturally acquired immunity • Result of having had an infection • Example: Chickenpox • Artificially acquired immunity • Result of receiving an immunization • Vaccine prompts the body to produce antibodies • Example: Hep B, Influenza, tetanus • Passive acquired immunity • Result of receiving antitoxin or immune globulins – Short lived • Protects person from current invasion of microorganisms • Example: Tetanus antitoxin • Naturally acquired passive immunity • Placental transmission or breast feeding - Short lived • Fetus receives antibodies from the mother 29 30 5/18/2024 16 Asepsis and Control of Microorganisms • ASEPSIS: Making the environment and objects free of microorganisms • Medical Asepsis: Reducing the number of organisms present or reducing the risk for infection • Clean technique – (dressing changes) • Environmental contamination • Home care • Hand hygiene • Surgical Asepsis: Prevention of exposure to living microorganisms • Sterile technique – OR, sterile procedures (Catheter insertion, central lines, epidurals) • Sterilization of instruments/equipment – Autoclave – kills ALL microorganisms Hand Hygiene • One of the most effective ways to reduce number of microorganisms on the hands • Gloves should be used to prevent contact with any body fluids • Health care workers must perform hand hygiene before and after giving care to a patient 31 32 5/18/2024 17 Skill 16.1 Hand Hygiene • Key points • Wash hands for 15 – 30 sec. with liquid soap • No rings (except simple wedding band) • Nails – short with no polish, gels, etc. • Point fingers down toward sink • Do not touch sink at any time • Turn off faucet, open door with clean paper towel • Use friction to all areas, rinse with running water So Why All the Fuss About Hand Hygiene? Most common mode of transmission of pathogens is via hands! ▪ Infections acquired in healthcare ▪ Spread of antimicrobial resistance 33 34 5/18/2024 18 Self-Reported Factors For Poor Adherence With Hand Hygiene ▪ Handwashing agents cause irritation and dryness ▪ Sinks are inconveniently located/lack of sinks ▪ Lack of soap and paper towels ▪ Too busy/insufficient time ▪ Understaffing/overcrowding ▪ Patient needs take priority ▪ Low risk of acquiring infection from patients Indications For Hand Hygiene ▪ When hands are visibly dirty, contaminated, or soiled, wash with non- antimicrobial or antimicrobial soap and water. ▪ If hands are not visibly soiled, you may use an alcohol-based hand rub for routinely decontaminating hands, except for C-Difficile cases or yeast infections. Wash with soap & water every 5 applications or more often. ▪ Do not substitute towelettes 35 36 5/18/2024 19 Specific Indications For Hand Hygiene • Before: • Patient contact • Donning gloves • Inserting urinary catheters, peripheral vascular catheters, or other invasive devices that don’t require surgery • After: • Patient contact • Removing gloves • Contact with body fluids or excretions, non-intact skin, wound dressings How to Prevent Transmission • Standard Precautions • Hand Hygiene • Wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) • Using cough etiquette • Protects you and the patient!! • Transmission Based Precautions • Used to prevent the spread of KNOWN infections • To be continued in Chapter 17 37 38 5/18/2024 20 Standard Precautions • Developed by the CDC to help break the chain of infection (see Box 16-3) • Consists of • 1. Hand hygiene • For every patient and every encounter • 2. Personal protective equipment (PPE) • Gloves, gowns, masks, protective eyewear, shoe covering and hair covering • Not all PPE is worn for every patient and encounter • 3. Safe handling of sharps and contaminated waste Standard Precautions • Previously called Universal Precautions • Assumes blood and body fluid of ANY patient could be infectious • Recommends PPE and other infection control practices to prevent transmission in any healthcare setting • Decisions about PPE use determined by type of clinical interaction with patient 39 40 5/18/2024 21 PPE For Standard Precautions • Gowns – Use during procedures and patient care activities when contact of clothing/ exposed skin with blood/body fluids, secretions, or excretions is anticipated • Mask and goggles or a face shield – Use during patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions • Head cover – Use commonly during surgery when skin can shed into the operative site. • Shoe covers – Use during procedures likely to generate splashes of body fluids. PPE For Standard Precautions • Gloves – Use when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, changing bed lines, contaminated items; for touching mucus membranes and nonintact skin • Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves 41 42 5/18/2024 22 Lifespan Considerations • Greater risk for infection due to immune system not as active as the younger client • Increase risk of developing a second infection because the body’s available defenses are already working to fight the first infection • Slower healing due to fewer immune cells available to fight infection • Table 16.5** Latex Allergy • Cumulative exposure effect • May impact both staff and patients • Assess latex risks in patients • Most common manifestation: • Dermatitis • More serious hypersensitivity reactions • Most gloves in hospitals are latex-free now 43 44 5/18/2024 23 Management of Sharps • Do not recap • Utilize protective sheathing if supplied on device • Dispose of in sharps containers • Do not allow overfilling of containers • Sharps accidents • Immediately clean • Report accident Contaminated Waste • Follow the guidelines in the facility • Most body fluids (ex. Gastric secretions) should be placed in a red biohazard plastic bag and placed in the appropriate container • Soiled linens – hold away from your body and place in appropriate receptacle 45 46 5/18/2024 24 Cleaning • Pathogens can be killed or inactivated by disinfection, sterilization, or sanitizing agents • Clean and remove debris in cold water • Wash and scrub in hot water; use a stiff-bristled brush • Rinse with hot water; dry Disinfection/Decontamination/ Sterilization • Disinfection • Chemical • Hard surfaces • Antisepsis • Reducing organisms on skin • Decontamination • Cleaning process • Sterilization • Elimination of all organisms by heat, gas, or chemicals 47 48 5/18/2024 25 SEPSIS IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT • A 1:10 solution of chlorine bleach and water can be used on counters and bathrooms • Run the dishwasher on the “sanitize” cycle • Frequent “damp” dusting and vacuuming reduces microorganisms • Forceps, scissors, and other instruments can be washed with hot water and detergent, then soaked in bleach solution INFECTION CONTROL SURVEILLANCE • Infection control practitioner • Responsible for ensuring infection prevention and control measures are followed • Works with the health care staff to ensure they understand which patient care and environmental cleaning measures are to be used • Assesses for spread of infection 49 50 5/18/2024 26 Question 1 The most effective way to destroy all types of microorganisms is to: A.
