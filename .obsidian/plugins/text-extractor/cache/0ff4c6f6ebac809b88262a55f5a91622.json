when they become curious ❖ Normal vitals o Respiratory rate: 25-55 o Heart rate: 80-150 ❖ Oral stage o Hold infants during feeding times o Sucking brings comforts and tension relief o Pt on IV fluids, they must have a pacifier to make sure the sucking need is met ❖ Motor development o Grasp reflex disappears around 3 months o Prehension: occurs around 5-6 months; orderly sequence of development; grasp object between fingers and opposing thumbs o Object permanence: when infant can remember that object exists even when it is out of sight o Parachute reflex: 7-9 months as a protective mechanism; occurs when infant is lowered to the ground and their reaction is to extend their arms out o Pincer grasp: well-established by 1 year of age ❖ Primitive reflexes o Moro (startle reflex): disappears 1-3 months o Rooting (rubbing cheek): disappears 3-4 months o Extrusion (tongue thrusting to keep solid foods out): disappears 5-6 months o Babinski (rubbing sole of foot and toes spread): disappears 12-18 months ❖ Emotional development o Consistency is necessary to develop trust o Infants who are consistently picked up when they cry, they tend to have fewer crying episodes and less aggressive behavior later o Never force infants to reach milestones o Once infant shows readiness to learn a task, encouragement is key ❖ Characteristics (skin) o Milia: small white papules; usually along nose o Nevi: “stork bites”; little red spots usually on forehead o Mongolian spots: very common with darker skin tones; be sure to chart that infant was born with them as they commonly get mistaken with signs of abuse ❖ Need for constant care and guidance o Sensory play o Soothe crying children o Do not delay feedings to stick to routine;
