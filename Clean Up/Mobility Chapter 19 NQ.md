5/28/2024 1 PREVENTION OF PRESSURE INJURIES CHAPTER 19 [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Contacts/Niomi Quinteros|Niomi Quinteros]] BSN, RN SKIN & PRESSURE INJURIES • A pressure injury forms due to local interference with circulation. • Blanch – skin turns white when pressure is applied. • The area stays red because if vasodilation (reactive hyperemia) – [[Blood]] rushes to where there is  circulation. If the area stays red and will not blanch, then this is a stage I pressure injury 5/28/2024 2 RISK FACTORS FOR PRESSURE INJURIES (SEE BOX 19-1) • Immobility and Inactivity • Moisture from incontinence or diaphoresis (sweating) • Maceration: softening of tissue that increases the chance of trauma or infection • Malnutrition • Advanced Age • Lowered mental awareness or sensory perception • Friction and Shear SKIN ASSESSMENT FOR PRESSURE INJURIES • Done upon admission; Braden Scale • Reassess every 24 hours. • Check pressure points when turning. • Redness is expected to be present for ½ to ¾ times as long as the pressure prevented [[Blood]] [[flow]]. Check for blanching. 5/28/2024 3 LEARN PRESSURE POINTS BRADEN SCALE 5/28/2024 4 INTERPRETING THE [[Braden Score]] • The lower the number the higher the risk • No risk: 19-23 • At risk: 15-18 • Moderate risk: 13-14 • High risk: 10-12 • Severe risk: 6-9 STAGING SYSTEM FOR PRESSURE INJURIES • Stage 1: Red, deep pink or mottled skin that does not blanch w/ pressure. Intact skin. • Stage 2: Partial-thickness skin loss. May look like an abrasion, blister or shallow crater. 5/28/2024 5 STAGE I PRESSURE INJURY STAGE 2 PRESSURE INJURY 5/28/2024 6 PRESSURE INJURIES • Stage 3: Full thickness skin loss involving subcutaneous (SC) tissue • Bacterial infection is common & causes drainage of wound • Stage 4: Full-thickness skin loss involving SC tissue, muscle, and bone (Infection) • May have necrotic, black tissue (eschar) • May be wet and oozing STAGE 3 PRESSURE INJURY 5/28/2024 7 STAGE 4 PRESSURE INJURY PRESSURE INJURIES • Unstageable: Loss of full thickness of tissue. Base of the injury is covered by eschar or slough. Eschar must be removed to stage the pressure injury properly • Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: localized discolored intact skin resulting from damage to underlying soft tissue. 5/28/2024 8 UNSTAGEABLE PRESSURE INJURY DEEP TISSUE PRESSURE INJURY 5/28/2024 9 PREVENTION OF PRESSURE INJURIES • Team Approach • Patient • Family • Caregivers • Health care providers Must have excellent nursing care. Treatment of Pressure Injuries A.J. is a 70 y/o male who is admitted with a Right Hemispheric Stroke (left side is paralyzed). He has a left facial droop & slurred speech but can communicate needs. He has a very poor appetite and refuses most meals and [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] protein shakes. He is incontinent and needs help with positioning and moving. He is 5’8” and weighs 100 pounds. • [[Braden Score]]: ?? 5/28/2024 10 ANSWER TO A.J.’S [[Braden Score]] • Sensory – 2 • Moisture – 1 • Activity – 2 • Mobility – 2 • Nutrition – 1 • Friction and Shear – 2 • Answer – 10 making him a high risk
