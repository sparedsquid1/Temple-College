### Mechanisms of Action
#### Summary of Montelukast Mechanism of Action (MOA)

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) that specifically targets and blocks the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1). By doing so, it inhibits the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid. These leukotrienes are primarily involved in causing bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and mucus secretion in conditions like asthma and allergic [[rhinitis]]. Montelukast's action reduces airway inflammation, alleviates symptoms, and improves breathing.

#### Explanation:

- **Leukotrienes**: These are molecules that play a significant role in inflammation, especially in [[Respiratory]] conditions.
- **CysLT1 receptor**: The primary target of montelukast, where leukotrienes exert their pro-inflammatory effects.
- **Blocking effects**: By binding to the receptor, montelukast prevents leukotrienes from triggering airway-related symptoms.
- **Therapeutic use**: This mechanism makes montelukast effective in managing asthma, allergic [[rhinitis]], and exercise-induced bronchospasm.
