When you were still together, you and your ex used to love the same hit song by Blink 182. Now, when you hear that song, you feel really sad. 2. You cringe when you pass the intersection where you nearly had a car accident. 3. Opening a can of pet food with an electric can opener leads your pet to start jumping around excitedly. 4. You see a horror movie featuring many explicit and bloody murders that take place in London, England. Now, any picture of London tends to make you feel uneasy. 5. A fourth-grade teacher who was strict and scary used to wear a strong, rose-scented perfume. The smell of roses now makes you very nervous. Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS) Unconditioned Response (UCR) Conditioned Stimulus (CS) Neutral Stimulus Conditioned Response (CR) 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Chapter 5 Learning, Classical Conditioning Handout & Exercises Instructions: For each scenario presented below, identify the four major elements of classical conditioning. Specify for each example the unconditioned stimulus (US), the unconditioned response (UR), conditioned stimulus (CS), and the conditioned response (CR). 1. You have a pet cat named Sam. You notice that every time you start to ruffle the bag of cat snacks, Sam comes running to you loudly meowing. This is because the sound of the bag of cat snacks has become the conditioned stimulus. What is the UR, US, and CR? US – CS – sound of the bag (of cat snacks) UR – CR – 2. Bob was driving and while turning right a car ran into him. Six months later, whenever Bob is driving he avoids making right turns. When Bob is required to make a right turn he begins to panic and hyperventilate. What is the US, UR, CS, and CR? US – CS – UR – CR – Panic and hyperventilate 3. A passenger on an airplane was feeling very anxious about an important job interview the next morning, and as a result he was uneasy and nervous throughout the flight. Back at home weeks later, he is contemplating a holiday trip. Though he hadn’t previously been afraid to fly, he finds himself suddenly nervous about flying and decided to cancel his plans to visit an out-of-state relative. What is the US, UR, CS, and CR? US – CS – UR – Nervous CR – 4. It’s no secret that people become unhappy when bad weather strikes, but what is surprising is that weather forecasters are consistently blamed for weather over which they obviously have no control. Weather forecasters around the country have been whacked by old ladies with umbrellas, pelted with snowballs, and even threatened with death (e.g., “You’re the one that sent that tornado and tore up my house. . .I’m going to take your head off!, or “If it snows over Christmas, you won’t live to see New Year’s!”) by people who mistakenly infer a causal relationship between the forecaster with subsequent foul weather patterns. US – Bad weather CS – UR – CR – 5. Why is it that automobile advertisements-especially those for sports cars-often feature beautiful young women? Because smart advertisers know (and research confirms) that new car ads that include an attractive female are rated by men as faster, more appealing, better-designed, and more desirable than similar ads that do not include an attractive female. US – CS – UR – Desire CR –","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
