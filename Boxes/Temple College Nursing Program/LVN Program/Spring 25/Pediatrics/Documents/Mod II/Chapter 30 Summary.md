### **Summary of Chapter 30: The Child with a Skin Condition**

#### **1. The Integumentary System in Children**

- **Differences Between Children and Adults:**
    
    - Infants have a thinner epidermis, leading to increased absorption.
    - The skin is drier, more prone to chapping, and has less subcutaneous fat.
    - Sweat glands mature by age 3, making thermoregulation difficult in young children.
- **Functions of the Skin:**
    
    - Provides protection, sensory perception (pain, temperature, touch, pressure), and secretion of sebum.
    - Plays a role in psychological and physiological health.
- **Structure of the Skin:**
    
    - Two main layers: Epidermis and Dermis.
    - Newborns may have **vernix caseosa** and **lanugo** for protection and insulation.
- **Skin Assessment:**
    
    - Evaluation includes color, texture, moisture, rashes, bruising, thickness, and condition of hair and fingernails.

#### **2. Common Skin Conditions in Infancy**

- **Milia** – Small white papules, benign.
- **Strawberry Nevus** – Red, raised birthmarks that may fade over time AKA Hemangioma.
- **Mongolian Spots** – Bluish-gray patches commonly seen in darker-skinned infants.
- **Portwine Nevus** – Permanent red or purple discoloration.

#### **3. Skin Infections in Children**

- **Miliaria** – Heat rash due to blocked sweat glands.
- **Intertrigo** – Reddened areas in skin folds due to friction and moisture.
- **Seborrheic Dermatitis** – Cradle cap, characterized by yellow, greasy scales.
- **Diaper Dermatitis** – Irritation from prolonged exposure to moisture.
- **Acne Vulgaris** – Common in adolescents, caused by clogged pores and inflammation.
- **Herpes Simplex Type I** – Cold sores triggered by stress or infection.

#### **4. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**

- Chronic inflammatory condition with a strong genetic link to allergies and asthma.
- **Management Goals:**
    - Relieve itching, hydrate skin, reduce inflammation, and prevent secondary infections.
    - Avoid overheating and exposure to irritants.
    - Medications include antihistamines and topical steroids.

#### **5. Bacterial Skin Infections**

- **Staphylococcal Infections:**
    
    - Common in newborns, affecting the umbilicus or circumcision wound.
    - Can lead to **septicemia** if untreated.
    - **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** requires contact isolation.
- **Scalded Skin Syndrome:**
    
    - Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to skin peeling and redness, mimicking burns.
    - Heals without scarring but requires treatment.
- **Impetigo:**
    
    - Caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria.
    - Highly contagious, characterized by honey-colored crusted lesions.
    - Treated with oral or topical antibiotics.

#### **6. Fungal Infections**

- **Types of Tinea Infections:**
    - **Tinea Capitis (Scalp Ringworm)** – Treated with Griseofulvin; sun exposure should be avoided.
    - **Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm), Tinea Pedis (Athlete’s Foot), Tinea Cruris (Jock Itch)** – Treated with antifungal creams like Clotrimazole.

#### **7. Parasitic Infections**

- **Pediculosis (Lice):**
    
    - Types: Head lice (Capitis), Body lice (Corporis), and Pubic lice (Pubis).
    - Treatments include medicated shampoos (Nix, Rid) and manual removal.
- **Scabies:**
    
    - Caused by mites, leading to intense itching, especially at night.
    - Treated with **Elimite (Permethrin)**; all close contacts require treatment.

#### **8. Burns in Children**

- Leading cause of accidental death in children aged 1-4 years.
    
- **Types of Burns:**
    
    - **Thermal** – Fire, scalding liquids.
    - **Chemical** – Corrosive substances.
    - **Electrical** – Current passing through the body.
    - **Radiation** – X-ray or radioactive exposure.
- **Children's Response to Burns:**
    
    - Thinner skin, larger body surface area, faster metabolism, and immature immune system make them more vulnerable.
- **Burn Classifications & Treatment:**
    
    - **Superficial (1st-degree)** – Redness, heals in 5-10 days.
    - **Partial-thickness (2nd-degree)** – Affects the epidermis and dermis, heals with proper wound care.
    - **Deep dermal burns** – Painful, with scarring potential.
    - **Full-thickness (3rd-degree)** – Destroys nerve endings, appears leathery and painless.
- **Emergency Burn Care:**
    
    - Stop the burn, assess the child, cover the burn, transport for medical care.
- **Burn Care & Grafting:**
    
    - **Minor burns** – Antimicrobial ointments, pain relief.
    - **Major burns** – Airway management, IV fluids, infection control.
    - **Grafts:**
        - **Permanent** – Autograft (patient’s skin), Isograft (identical twin).
        - **Temporary** – Homograft (cadaver), Heterograft (animal skin), Porcine xenograft.
