(b) needs are organized in a hierarchy of prepotency in which more basic needs must be more or less met (rather than all or none) prior to higher needs. (c) the order of needs is not rigid but instead may be flexible based on external circumstances or individual differences. (d) most behavior is multi-motivated, that is, simultaneously determined by more than one basic need.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
