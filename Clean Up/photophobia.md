Photophobia is a condition where an individual has an abnormal sensitivity to light, leading to discomfort or pain in the eyes when exposed to light sources. It can range from mild discomfort in bright light to severe pain even in low-light conditions.

### Causes of Photophobia
Photophobia can be caused by various factors, including:
- **Eye Conditions**: 
  - **Dry eye syndrome**
  - **Conjunctivitis** (inflammation of the conjunctiva)
  - **Uveitis** (inflammation of the uvea)
  - **Corneal abrasion** (scratch on the cornea)
- **Neurological Conditions**: 
  - **Migraines**: Photophobia is a common symptom during a migraine attack.
  - **Meningitis**: Inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and [[Spinal cord]].
  - **Traumatic brain injury**: Sensitivity to light can occur after a head injury.
- **Medications**: Some medications, like certain antibiotics or [[Diuretics]], can make the eyes more sensitive to light.
- **Psychiatric Conditions**: In rare cases, photophobia may be associated with psychiatric disorders like [[anxiety]] or [[agoraphobia]].

### Symptoms
- Squinting or closing the eyes when exposed to light
- Headache or eye pain in bright environments
- Avoidance of well-lit areas or wearing sunglasses indoors

### Treatment
- **Addressing the Underlying Cause**: Treating the root cause (e.g., migraines, eye conditions) often reduces photophobia.
- **Wearing Sunglasses**: Especially those with polarized lenses, to reduce light sensitivity.
- **Using Tinted Lenses**: Some people benefit from specially tinted glasses that block specific wavelengths of light.
- **Eye Drops**: Artificial tears or other prescribed eye drops may alleviate symptoms if the photophobia is related to dry eyes or inflammation.

If you're experiencing photophobia, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
