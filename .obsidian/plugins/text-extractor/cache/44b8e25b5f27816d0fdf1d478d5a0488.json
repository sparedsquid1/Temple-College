Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Three-Step Analgesic Pain Intensity Treatment #1  The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a three- step analgesic protocol based on intensity as a guideline for treating pain. The “pain ladder” directs the use of both opioids and nonopioids in the treatment of mild to severe pain. o Step 1: Mild pain—nonopioid analgesic sometimes with an adjuvant o Step 2: Moderate pain—weak opioid substances o Step 3: Severe and persistent pain—potent opioid substances Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Three-Step Analgesic Pain Intensity Treatment #2  Health care providers sometimes use a “4th step” for chronic pain sufferers that develop severe pain using nerve stimulators or blocks with anesthetics or continuous pump infusions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Introduction to Opioid Analgesics Controlled substances Do not change tissues where pain originates Change client’s perception of pain Treat pain centrally in the brain Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Types of Opioid Analgesics Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Actions #1  Cells within central nervous system  Mu and kappa receptors produce the analgesic, sedative, and euphoric effects associated with analgesic drugs  Agonist agents—bind well to the receptors  Opioid analgesic can be a(n): o Agonist o Partial agonist o Agonist–antagonist Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Actions #2  Bodily Responses Associated with Opioid Receptor Sites Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Uses  Treat moderate to severe acute and chronic pain  Manage opiate dependence  Decrease anxiety/sedation  Adjunct to anesthesia  Promote obstetric analgesia  Treat pain for an extended time when administered intrathecally/epidurally  To relieve pain from a myocardial infarction  Treats severe diarrhea; intestinal cramping; severe, persistent cough  Treats severe, persistent cough Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #1  Central Nervous System Reactions: o Euphoria, weakness o Headache o Lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation o Miosis, insomnia, agitation, tremor o Increased intracranial pressure, impairment of mental and physical tasks Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #2  Respiratory System Reactions o Depression of rate and depth of breathing Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #3  Gastrointestinal System Reactions: o Nausea, vomiting o Dry mouth, biliary tract spasms o Constipation , anorexia Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #4  Cardiovascular System Reactions: o Facial flushing o Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations o Peripheral circulatory collapse Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #5  Genitourinary System Reactions: o Urinary retention or hesitancy o Spasms of the ureters and bladder sphincter Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Adverse Reactions #6  Allergic and Other Reactions: o Pruritus o Rash o Urticaria o Sweating o Pain at injection site o Local tissue irritation Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Contraindications  Contraindicated in clients with: o known hypersensitivity to opioids o acute bronchial asthma, emphysema, or upper airway obstruction o head injury or increased intracranial pressure o convulsive disorders; severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; acute ulcerative colitis o Pregnancy (pregnancy category B and C drugs) or labor Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Precautions  Used cautiously in: o Older adults o Clients considered opioid naïve o Clients undergoing biliary surgery o Clients who are lactating o Clients with undiagnosed abdominal pain, hypoxia, supraventricular tachycardia, prostatic hypertrophy, and renal or hepatic impairment Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Analgesics—Interactions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Pharmacology in Practice Exercise #1  A nurse is caring for a client who is prescribed opioid analgesics. Which of the following is an allergic reaction to opioid analgesics? a) Constipation b) Urticaria c) Palpitations d) Facial flushing Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved The Opioid Crisis  Opioids are addictive  Pain initiatives launched in several states in the United States that promoted health care providers to recognize and treat pain  Pain became the 5th vital sign  Overprescription of opioid analgesics  Problems with overdose and death from opioid analgesics  Nurses need to be able to respond to opioid overuse for both immediate rescue and long-term treatment of addiction Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Antagonists—Actions  Antagonist: greater affinity for opiate cell surface receptors than the opioid drug (agonists); competes for the receptor  Prevents or reverses all effects; pain will return  If the client has no opioid in their system, the antagonist has no drug effect Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Opioid Antagonists—Uses  Naloxone  Postoperative acute respiratory depression  Opioid adverse effects (reversal)  Suspected acute opioid overdosage  Other opioid antagonists are used to

after an oral medication o Notify primary health care provider if analgesic is ineffective o Inquire about details of pain Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Nursing Process—Client Receiving an Opioid Analgesic for Pain/Rescue from Respiratory Depression #4  Ongoing Assessment (continued) o Nursing judgment: when a change in pain/intensity or location needs to be reported to the primary health care provider o Opioid- naïve client: risk for respiratory depression (respiratory rate less than 10 breaths per minute) o If being used as an antidiarrheal, document each bowel movement and notify the primary health care provider if symptoms become worse, abdominal pain, or blood in stool Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Nursing Process—Client Receiving an Opioid Analgesic for Pain/Rescue from Respiratory Depression #5  Assessment for Opioid Antagonist o Preadministration Assessment  Assess and document blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate o

Continue to monitor respiratory rate, rhythm, and depth; pulse; blood pressure; and level of consciousness until the effects of opioids have worn off  A repeat dose of naloxone may be ordered if the opioid seems to have a longer effect Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Nursing Process—Client Receiving an Opioid Analgesic for Pain/Rescue from Respiratory Depression #6  Nursing Diagnoses Opioid Agonist o Altered Breathing Pattern related to pain and effects on breathing center by opioids o Injury Risk related to dizziness or lightheadedness from opioid administration o
