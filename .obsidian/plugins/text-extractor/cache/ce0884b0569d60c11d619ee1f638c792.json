If the condition persists and is unresponsive to treatment or becomes chronic, surgery is considered to rule out other conditions. 3 The nurse needs to explain the necessity and process for monitoring the ability to void. The patient will need to keep a diary with times and amounts of urination. 4 Information about prevention is important. The nurse will discuss all measures that can cause prostatitis and how to prevent reinfection. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 2. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 43.

It is not known from the information given if the patient is having a high-risk procedure. There is no reason to alarm the patient unnecessarily. 2 This reply is inappropriate because it makes an assumption about the patient’s sexual function based on age. 3 It is inappropriate for the nurse to talk about treatments. It is not known from the Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company information given if the patient is having a high-risk procedure. There is no reason to alarm the patient unnecessarily. 4 Some types of prostate procedures can lead to erectile dysfunction. The physician needs to address this risk with the patient.

A Foley catheter is left in place with 30 to 60 mL of sterile water inflating the balloon. The balloon is overfilled and may be secured tightly to the leg or abdomen to tamponade (compress) the prostate area and stop the bleeding. 3 The health care provider (HCP) will remove the Foley catheter after the danger of hemorrhage has passed. 4 Irrigation solution generally flows continuously; manual irrigation may be done for the first 24 hours to help maintain catheter patency by removing clots and tissue shreds.

Page: 907 Heading: Cancer of the Prostate Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Cellular Regulation Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 When prostate cancers are determined to be slow growing, treatment does not always indicate the need for a radical prostatectomy. 2 A digital examination of the prostate will reveal a small hardened lump or lobe. The decision to perform a radical prostatectomy will depend on the type of Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company cancer and whether metastases has occurred. 3 Metastases of prostate cancer frequently involves pain in bone tissue, most often of the back or hip. Bone pain may be an indication for a radical prostatectomy. 4 The decision for a radical prostatectomy is made based on physiological indications. Age is not a determining factor, and the patient’s age is not necessarily an indication of sexual or reproductive functioning. PTS: 1 CON: Cellular Regulation 7. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 43.

Page: 910 Heading: Priapism Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Prolonged priapism can result in the inability to urinate, which can lead to bladder distention, dilation of the ureters, and hydronephrosis. This condition is considered serious. 2 The patient’s pain level is to be monitored, but the presence of pain is expected and not considered to be serious. 3 After priapism, the patient may have an inability to have an erection. However, the nurse will not be monitoring for this condition. Diagnosis will occur after recovery from the episode. 4 The patient with prolonged priapism is at risk for penile tissue necrosis due to a lack of oxygen. However, the condition is not likely to occur during emergency care. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 8. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 43.

A. Davis Company 1 With the diagnosis of epididymitis, it is possible for the patient to develop an abscess as a complication. 2 Orchitis is inflammation/infection of the testicles; it can be caused by trauma or infection from epididymitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or systemic diseases. However, because orchitis is a rare condition, it is the least likely complication. 3 It is possible for the patient with epididymitis to develop sterility. 4 Acute epididymitis can become a chronic condition if not treated or not responsive to treatment.

Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 2 Three months of additional birth control provides protection until the lack of sperm passage is validated. 3 This statement indicates a need for additional teaching. Sperm will continue to be produced by the testes, but they will be absorbed by the body. 4 The evaluation of a semen sample is the most effective way to confirm the success of a vasectomy. Unprotected intercourse should not be experienced before this confirmation. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 11. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 43.

Researchers now believe that 80 to 90 percennt are caused by physical problems. 2 This statement does not provide the patient with support. Also, the nurse does not know if the patient and spouse have already discussed the issue. 3 The nurse can support the patient by replacing the client’s negative terminology with the term of erectile dysfunction. The term impotence carries a negative meaning of “powerlessness.” 4 The problem may be related to fatigue and stress, but there is no indication that the patient is experiencing either outside the problem itself. This does not provide the patient with the best support. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 12. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 43.

The report notes no physiological disorders. 2 Testicular infertility is caused by two factors: varicoceles and idiopathic. The report notes no physiological disorder, which would include varicoceles. However, idiopathic causes are numerous: A common cause is anything that raises the temperature of the testes or causes damage or injury. 3 Posttesticular infertility is caused by any surgery or injury along the path of the sperm from the testes to the outside of the body, such as vasectomy or any other surgery that can cause retrograde ejaculation. 4 Hormonal infertility by definition is considered pretesticular.

A. Davis Company be considered, but may not be possible. Any antihypertensive medication will likely cause a hypotensive episode when sildenafil is used. 2 The patient is a diabetic and may very well have compromised penile circulation. Acquisition of this knowledge does not alone meet the patient’s need. 3 Several herbal remedies may be effective in resolving erectile dysfunction, such as yohimbine, ginseng, gingko, and others. The patient needs to understand that herbal therapies can have side effects and the HCP should be aware of the therapy. 4 Testing to validate an adequate testosterone level will not alone meet the patient’s need.

Because the patient is at risk for additional lesions, the patient and the patient’s partner may benefit by having protected sex. 2 It is important for the patient to understand the importance of good hygiene, especially when uncircumcised. 3 The patient is at risk for reoccurrence of penile cancer. Monitoring for lesions regularly allows for early treatment. 4 If a male patient has had penile cancer, he may want to consider being circumcised to decrease the risk of reoccurrence of the disease.

A. Davis Company 1 When a section of the vas deferens is removed during a vasectomy, the HCP may not be able to reconnect the ends. However, another type of surgery is available. 2 It is true that sperm production may be limited or absent, depending on the time lapse for the vasectomy. However, this fact alone does not reflect the success of the surgery. 3 Reversed vasectomy is more likely to be successful if the time span from the vasectomy is short. The reconstruction process and sperm production both decline with the passage of time. 4 When the ends of the vas deferens are too short or are unable to be reconnected, the vas deferens can be connected directly to the epididymis.

Treatment from this category may or may not be effective. This is unlikely to be the HCP’s initial prescription. 2 Oral medications such as tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil are now the first line of therapy used to treat erectile dysfunction. 3 Testosterone replacement can be prescribed if a deficiency is identified. The HCP must assure that the patient does not have contraindications such as prostate cancer. This is not likely to be the HCP’s first approach. 4 Penile injections are a possible treatment for erectile dysfunction; however, it requires careful evaluation of the patient and the patient’s partner to determine their ability to perform the injections.
