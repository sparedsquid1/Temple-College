Brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP) is a type of psychotherapy that combines elements from various therapeutic approaches to help individuals with PTSD. It is characterized by:

* A brief, time-limited approach (typically 12-20 sessions)
* An eclectic mix of techniques and strategies drawn from different theoretical orientations
* A focus on helping the individual develop coping skills and strategies to manage their symptoms
* An emphasis on building a strong therapeutic relationship

BEP may incorporate elements from cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and other approaches. The goal of BEP is to help individuals with PTSD re-establish a sense of safety and control over their lives, and to reduce symptoms of PTSD.
