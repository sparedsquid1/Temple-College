Partial reinforcement effect: Behaviors that are conditioned using partial reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than behaviors that are conditioned using continuous reinforcement. Schedule of reinforcement: delivery of a reinforcer according to a preset pattern based on the number of responses or the time interval between responses. • Fixed-ratio (FR) schedule: reinforcement schedule in which a reinforcer is delivered after a fixed number of responses has occurred • Variable-ratio (VR) schedule: reinforcement schedule in which a reinforcer is delivered after an average number of responses, which varies unpredictably from trial to trial. • Fixed-interval (FI) schedule: reinforcement schedule in which a reinforcer is delivered for the first response that occurs after a preset time interval has elapsed. • Variable-interval (VI) schedule: reinforcement schedule in which a reinforcer is delivered for the first response that occurs after an average time interval, which varies unpredictably from trial to trial. Fixed Ratio – rewards given after a fixed number of responses. Example, piece work when an individual is paid after a certain/fixed number of boxes are packed. Variable Ratio – rewards given after varying number of responses. Example, gambling, clot machines, lottery, bingo. This is the most difficult to extinguish. Fixed Interval – rewards given after a fixed period of time. Example, weekly or monthly salary. Variable Interval – rewards given after varying periods of time. Example, a pop quiz. This will likely increase studying behavior. Schedules of reinforcement are powerful influences on behavior. According to Skinner (1974), behavior is determined and controlled by environmental stimuli and your history of reinforcement—not by conscious choices.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
