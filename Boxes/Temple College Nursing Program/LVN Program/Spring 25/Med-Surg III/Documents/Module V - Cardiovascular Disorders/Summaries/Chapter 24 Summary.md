## 📘 **Chapter Summary: Occlusive Cardiovascular Disorders**

### 🌡️ **Arteriosclerosis & Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**
- **Arteriosclerosis**: Hardening/narrowing of arteries due to **plaque buildup (atherosclerosis)**.
- Increases risk for **coronary artery disease (CAD)**, which obstructs **blood flow to the heart**.
- **Risk factors**: High cholesterol, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, stress, diabetes, hypertension, age, ethnicity (e.g., African Americans), and low HDL.

---

### 💔 **Angina Pectoris**
- **Stable Angina**: Predictable chest pain with exertion; relieved by rest/nitroglycerin.
- **Unstable Angina**: Unpredictable; not relieved by rest or meds—may lead to **MI**.
- **Variant Angina (Prinzmetal’s)**: Coronary artery spasm; often occurs at night.
- **Microvascular Angina**: Spasms in small cardiac vessels; more severe, lasts longer.
- **Symptoms**: Chest pressure, burning, pain radiating to arm/jaw/back, shortness of breath, diaphoresis.

---

### 🧪 **Diagnostic Tools**
- **ECG**, **stress test**, **echocardiogram**, **coronary angiography**.

---

### 💊 **Angina Treatment**
- **Nitroglycerin**: Vasodilation to improve oxygen delivery; educate on correct use/storage.
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Decrease contractility (e.g., Norvasc, Cardizem).
- **Beta Blockers**: Reduce HR and BP (e.g., Lopressor); contraindicated in asthma.
- **ACE Inhibitors**: Vasodilate by blocking angiotensin (e.g., Capoten); monitor BP.
- **Statins**: Lower LDL (e.g., Lipitor); monitor liver and muscle pain.
- **Antiplatelets**: Prevent clotting (e.g., aspirin, Plavix); watch for bleeding.

---

### ⚠️ **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) & Myocardial Infarction (MI)**
- **Silent Ischemia**: No symptoms; common in elderly, diabetics.
- **MI**: Heart muscle death from full/partial artery blockage (STEMI/NSTEMI).
- **Symptoms**: Severe chest pain not relieved by rest, "crushing" pain, SOB, nausea.
- Women may have atypical symptoms: fatigue, jaw pain, indigestion.
- **Time is crucial**—delayed care increases damage.

---

### 🩺 **MI Treatment**
- **MONA**: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin.
- **Thrombolytics**, **angioplasty**, **stents**, **CABG surgery**.
- **CABG**: Uses vein/artery grafts to bypass blocked vessels.

---

### 🦵 **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**
- Caused by **atherosclerosis** in leg arteries.
- **Symptoms**: Intermittent claudication, cool pale skin, hair loss, diminished pulses.
- **Treatment**: Lifestyle change, meds (vasodilators, antiplatelets), stents, bypass.

---

### 🧊 **Raynaud’s Disease**
- **Spasm of arteries** in response to cold/stress, mostly in fingers/toes.
- Skin turns white, blue, then red.
- **Management**: Keep warm, avoid caffeine/smoking, take vasodilators.

---

### 🩸 **Arterial Thrombosis/Embolism**
- **Sudden onset** due to a clot; risk of tissue death.
- **6 P’s**: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia.
- **Treatment**: IV heparin, thrombolytics, surgery.

---

### 🧠 **Aneurysms**
- Ballooning of weakened artery wall (commonly abdominal aortic).
- **Symptoms**: Often none; pain, pulsating mass may indicate rupture.
- **Treatment**: Monitor, control BP, surgical repair if >5 cm.

---

### 🦵 **Varicose Veins & Venous Ulcers**
- **Varicose Veins**: Twisted, enlarged veins due to valve dysfunction.
- **Treatment**: Compression, elevation, surgery.
- **Venous Ulcers**: From chronic venous insufficiency; hard to heal.
- **Care**: Compression therapy, Unna boot, wound care.

---

### 🩻 **Vascular Surgery**
- **Embolectomy/Thrombectomy**, **vascular grafts**, **endarterectomy**.
- **Post-op care**: Monitor pulses, bleeding, labs (CBC, INR, PTT), neuro checks.

# **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

---

**1. A patient is prescribed nitroglycerin for angina. Which instruction is most important?**  
**A. Take it with food.**  
**B. Swallow it whole.**  
**C. Keep in original container.** ✅  
**D. Use after erectile dysfunction meds.**

✅ **Rationale**: Nitroglycerin is light-sensitive; original amber container protects efficacy.

---

**2. A nurse assesses for which classic MI symptom in women?**  
**A. Crushing chest pain**  
**B. Left arm pain only**  
**C. Nausea and fatigue** ✅  
**D. Cold sweats**

✅ **Rationale**: Women often present with nonspecific symptoms like fatigue and indigestion.

---

**3. Which finding indicates Raynaud’s disease?**  
**A. Warm, flushed hands**  
**B. Pale and cyanotic fingertips in cold** ✅  
**C. Rapid heart rate**  
**D. Unilateral leg pain**

✅ **Rationale**: Raynaud’s presents with color changes in extremities due to vasospasm.

---

**4. The priority nursing diagnosis for arterial embolism is:**  
**A. Risk for infection**  
**B. Activity intolerance**  
**C. Ineffective tissue perfusion** ✅  
**D. Disturbed body image**

✅ **Rationale**: Embolism compromises blood flow—tissue perfusion is top priority.

---

**5. What should be assessed post-CABG surgery?**  
**A. Pupils**  
**B. Lung sounds only**  
**C. Peripheral pulses and drainage** ✅  
**D. Ear temperature**

✅ **Rationale**: Post-op complications may include bleeding or occlusion—check pulses.

---

**6. Which is the best indicator of effective statin therapy?**  
**A. Blood pressure drop**  
**B. Decreased LDL level** ✅  
**C. Lower heart rate**
