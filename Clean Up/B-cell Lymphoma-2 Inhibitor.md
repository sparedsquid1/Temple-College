B-cell [[Lymphoma]] 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors are a class of targeted cancer therapies that specifically target the BCL-2 protein, a key regulator of apoptosis (programmed cell death). BCL-2 is often overexpressed in cancer cells, particularly in certain types of [[Blood]] cancers, where it contributes to the survival of these cells by preventing apoptosis. BCL-2 inhibitors work by restoring the cellâ€™s ability to undergo apoptosis, thereby killing cancer cells.

### Key Concepts:

- **BCL-2 Protein:** BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell death by preventing the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK. By inhibiting apoptosis, BCL-2 helps cells survive under conditions that would normally trigger cell death. In many cancers, particularly hematologic malignancies like chronic lymphocytic [[Leukemia]] ([[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]) and certain types of [[Lymphoma]], BCL-2 is overexpressed, allowing cancer cells to evade apoptosis and continue proliferating.

- **Apoptosis and Cancer:** Apoptosis is a natural process that removes damaged or unneeded cells. Cancer cells often develop mechanisms to avoid apoptosis, which contributes to their uncontrolled growth and resistance to therapy. Targeting the proteins that regulate apoptosis, like BCL-2, can therefore be an effective strategy in cancer treatment.

### Interactions:

- **Inhibition of BCL-2:** BCL-2 inhibitors, such as **[[venetoclax]] (Venclexta)**, bind to the BCL-2 protein and inhibit its function. This inhibition disrupts the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals within the cell, leading to the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX and BAK.

- **[[induction]] of Apoptosis:** By inhibiting BCL-2, these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] allow the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria, which then initiate the cascade of events leading to apoptosis. This process selectively induces death in cancer cells that are dependent on BCL-2 for survival.

### Clinical Applications:

- **Chronic Lymphocytic [[Leukemia]] ([[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]):** [[venetoclax]] is approved for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. It is especially effective in patients with the 17p deletion, a genetic abnormality that makes [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] cells more resistant to chemotherapy but more reliant on BCL-2.

- **Acute Myeloid [[Leukemia]] ([[acute myelocytic leukemia]]):** [[venetoclax]] is also used in combination with other agents, such as hypomethylating agents or low-dose [[cytarabine (ara-C)]], for the treatment of newly diagnosed [[acute myelocytic leukemia]] in older patients or those who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

- **Other Lymphomas:** Research is ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of BCL-2 inhibitors in other types of lymphomas and hematologic malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell [[Lymphoma]] (DLBCL) and mantle cell [[Lymphoma]].

### Side Effects and Considerations:

- **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):** A potentially serious side effect of BCL-2 inhibitors, TLS occurs when large numbers of cancer cells are rapidly destroyed, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to kidney failure, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications. Patients starting on BCL-2 inhibitors like [[venetoclax]] are carefully monitored for signs of TLS, and prophylactic measures, including hydration and medications, are often used to prevent it.

- **Common Side Effects:** These include [[neutropenia]] (low white [[Blood]] cell count), anemia, [[thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue.

- **Combination Therapy:** [[venetoclax]] is often used in combination with other [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], such as [[rituximab]] or [[obinutuzumab]] in [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], to enhance its effectiveness and overcome resistance mechanisms.

### Summary:

BCL-2 inhibitors like [[venetoclax]] represent a significant advance in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies, particularly [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] and [[acute myelocytic leukemia]]. By targeting the BCL-2 protein, these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] restore the apoptotic process in cancer cells, leading to their selective death. While highly effective, especially in patients with specific genetic mutations, BCL-2 inhibitors require careful management of potential side effects, particularly tumor lysis syndrome. Their use in combination with other therapies continues to expand, offering new hope for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.
