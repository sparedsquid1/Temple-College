Hypersensitivity reactions are abnormal or excessive immune responses to a substance that is normally harmless. These reactions can be categorized into four types:

1. **Type I (Immediate or Anaphylactic Reaction)**: This reaction occurs within minutes of exposure to an allergen and involves the release of histamine and other chemicals from mast cells and basophils. Symptoms include sneezing, itching, swelling, and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis.

2. **Type II (Cytotoxic Reaction)**: This reaction involves the production of antibodies that target and destroy cells or tissues. Examples include autoimmune hemolytic anemia and certain drug reactions.

3. **Type III (Immune Complex Reaction)**: This reaction occurs when immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) form and deposit in tissues, leading to inflammation. Conditions like [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] ([[systemic lupus erythematosus]]) and rheumatoid arthritis involve Type III hypersensitivity.

4. **Type IV (Delayed-Type Reaction)**: This reaction is mediated by T cells and occurs 24-48 hours after exposure to an allergen. It is responsible for contact dermatitis (such as from poison ivy) and certain drug reactions.

These reactions can range from mild to severe and may require different approaches for management and treatment.
