Nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage caused by exposure to harmful substances. This condition can impair kidney function, leading to an inability to properly filter waste products from the [[Blood]], maintain electrolyte balance, and regulate fluid levels. Nephrotoxicity can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (long-term).

### Causes of Nephrotoxicity
1. **Medications:** Certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]]), antibiotics (e.g., [[Aminoglycosides]], [[vancomycin]]), and chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., [[cisplatin]]), can cause kidney damage.
2. **Toxins:** Exposure to heavy metals (like lead and mercury), industrial chemicals, or certain contrast dyes used in imaging tests can lead to nephrotoxicity.
3. **Herbal Supplements:** Some herbal products contain nephrotoxic compounds.
4. **Infections:** Severe infections that affect the kidneys, such as sepsis, can also cause nephrotoxicity.
5. **Underlying Health Conditions:** Conditions like diabetes and high [[Blood]] pressure can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity, especially when combined with nephrotoxic agents.

### Symptoms
- Reduced urine output
- Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet
- Fatigue and weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Confusion or difficulty concentrating
- High [[Blood]] pressure
- Shortness of breath (in severe cases)

### Diagnosis
- **[[Blood]] Tests:** To check for elevated levels of creatinine and [[Blood]] urea nitrogen ([[BUN]]), which indicate impaired kidney function.
- **Urine Tests:** To detect abnormalities in urine composition, such as proteinuria or hematuria.
- **Imaging Tests:** [[ultrasound]] or CT scans can help visualize the kidneys and detect structural abnormalities.
- **Kidney Biopsy:** In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to determine the extent and type of kidney damage.

### Treatment
- **Discontinuation of Nephrotoxic Agents:** Stopping or adjusting the dose of the offending drug or substance.
- **Hydration:** Ensuring adequate fluid intake to help flush toxins from the kidneys.
- **Medications:** Using medications to manage symptoms, control [[Blood]] pressure, and treat underlying conditions.
- **Dialysis:** In severe cases, dialysis may be needed to support kidney function.

Preventing nephrotoxicity involves careful monitoring of kidney function, especially in individuals taking potentially nephrotoxic medications or those with preexisting kidney conditions.
