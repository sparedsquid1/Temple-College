Proteasome inhibitors are a class of [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that block the activity of proteasomes, which are protein complexes in cells responsible for degrading unneeded or damaged proteins. By inhibiting proteasomes, these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] disrupt the regulated degradation of proteins, leading to the accumulation of defective or excess proteins in cells. This disruption is particularly lethal to cancer cells, which rely heavily on proteasomes for their rapid growth and survival.

### Key Concepts:

- **Proteasomes:** Proteasomes are large protein complexes that degrade unneeded, damaged, or misfolded proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and apoptosis.

- **Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway:** Proteins targeted for degradation are typically tagged with a small protein called ubiquitin. Once tagged, these proteins are recognized and degraded by the proteasome. This pathway is crucial for regulating protein levels and quality within the cell.

### Interactions:

- **Inhibition of Proteasome Activity:** Proteasome inhibitors, such as **[[bortezomib]] (Velcade)**, **[[carfilzomib]] (Kyprolis)**, and **[[ixazomib]] (Ninlaro)**, bind to the proteasome and inhibit its proteolytic activity. This leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within the cell.

- **[[induction]] of Apoptosis:** The accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins causes stress within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupts normal cellular functions. In cancer cells, this stress can trigger apoptosis, or programmed cell death, particularly because these cells are more dependent on the proteasome for their rapid growth and survival.

### Clinical Applications:

- **Multiple [[myeloma]]:** Proteasome inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of multiple [[myeloma]], a type of [[Blood]] cancer that arises from plasma cells. [[bortezomib]] was the first proteasome inhibitor approved for this purpose and has significantly improved outcomes for patients with multiple [[myeloma]].
  
- **Mantle Cell [[Lymphoma]]:** [[bortezomib]] is also approved for the treatment of mantle cell [[Lymphoma]], another type of [[Blood]] cancer.

- **Combination Therapy:** Proteasome inhibitors are often used in combination with other [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], such as immunomodulatory agents (e.g., [[lenalidomide]]) and [[Corticosteroids]] (e.g., [[dexamethasone]]), to enhance their effectiveness.

### Side Effects and Considerations:

- **Common Side Effects:** These can include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage causing pain or numbness), fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation), [[thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), and anemia.

- **Cardiac and Pulmonary Toxicity:** [[carfilzomib]], in particular, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular side effects, including [[Heart]] failure and hypertension, as well as pulmonary complications.

- **Resistance:** Cancer cells can develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors through various mechanisms, such as mutations in the proteasome subunits or compensatory activation of alternative pathways. Overcoming this resistance is a focus of ongoing research.

### Summary:

Proteasome inhibitors have transformed the treatment landscape for multiple [[myeloma]] and other [[Blood]] cancers by targeting the cellular machinery that cancer cells depend on for survival. These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] effectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, particularly in those that are highly proliferative and reliant on proteasome activity. However, their use requires careful management of side effects and the potential for drug resistance. The development of newer proteasome inhibitors and combination therapies continues to improve outcomes for patients with these challenging malignancies.
