Hepatic coma, also known as [[Hepatic encephalopathy]], is a serious condition that occurs when [[Liver]] dysfunction leads to a buildup of toxins in the bloodstream. This buildup can affect brain function, causing symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, and even loss of consciousness. It's often seen in people with severe [[Liver]] disease, such as cirrhosis or acute [[Liver]] failure. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying [[Liver]] problem and managing symptoms to improve brain function.
