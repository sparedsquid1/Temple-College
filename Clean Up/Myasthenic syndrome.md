Myasthenic syndrome, also known as Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, where nerves connect with the muscles they control. In LEMS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the voltage-gated calcium channels on nerve endings. This attack impairs the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter necessary for muscle contraction.

### Key Features of LEMS:

1. **Muscle Weakness**: Muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles (those closer to the center of the body), is a hallmark of LEMS. This typically affects the legs more than the arms and can lead to difficulty in climbing stairs, standing up from a seated position, or lifting objects.

2. **Fatigability**: Muscle strength may improve temporarily after exertion, but quickly fatigues with repeated use.

3. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: Symptoms such as dry [[Mouth]], constipation, erectile dysfunction, and impaired sweating can occur due to the involvement of the autonomic nervous system.

4. **Association with Cancer**: LEMS is often associated with small cell lung cancer ([[SCLC]]). In some cases, LEMS can be a paraneoplastic syndrome, meaning it is triggered by an immune response to a tumor.

5. **Diagnosis**: LEMS is diagnosed through a combination of [[Clinical Evaluation]], electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and [[Blood]] tests for antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels.

6. **Treatment**: Treatment may involve medications to improve neuromuscular transmission (such as 3,4-diaminopyridine or [[pyridostigmine]]), immunosuppressive therapies (such as [[Corticosteroids]] or intravenous immunoglobulin), and addressing any underlying malignancy if present.
