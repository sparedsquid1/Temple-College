Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability of [[Blood]] to clot properly due to a deficiency or absence of factor VIII, a crucial protein in the [[Blood]] clotting process. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning it primarily affects males, while females can be carriers of the disease.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Bleeding Tendency**: Individuals with Hemophilia A experience prolonged bleeding after injuries, surgeries, or even spontaneously, particularly into joints and muscles.
- **Severity**: The severity of the condition varies depending on the amount of functional factor VIII in the [[Blood]]. It can range from mild to severe.
  - **Mild**: 5-40% of normal factor VIII levels
  - **Moderate**: 1-5% of normal levels
  - **Severe**: Less than 1% of normal levels
- **Symptoms**: Common symptoms include easy bruising, joint pain and swelling due to internal bleeding, and prolonged bleeding from cuts, injuries, or surgery.

### Diagnosis and Treatment:
- **Diagnosis**: Hemophilia A is diagnosed through [[Blood]] tests that measure clotting factor levels, specifically factor VIII.
- **Treatment**: The main treatment is replacement therapy, where factor VIII concentrates are infused into the bloodstream to prevent or control bleeding episodes. Other treatments may include the use of medications like [[desmopressin]] (for mild cases) and preventive care to avoid injuries.

With appropriate treatment and care, individuals with Hemophilia A can lead relatively normal lives, although managing the condition requires ongoing medical support.
