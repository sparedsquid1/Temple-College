Self-Reflection form is to be typed and submitted in a Microsoft Word document Self-Reflection form is to be uploaded into D2L Clinical Course Dropbox. Be sure to complete all areas of the form. Think about your day and performance, what you learned, and what you could change or start doing. Unsatisfactory self-reflections will be returned for revision and resubmission. A. Discuss what you have learned from this clinical simulation? Be sure to include information related to aspects of patient care, observation of others, and any other pertinent area not listed. (Must have a minimum of 5 complete sentences) The flow of conversation is important to foster the feeling of support and care being provided to loved ones. It is important to answer all questions in a manner that is not condescending and complete. Not to speak to someone in medical jargon but when using medical jargon explain that term in plain English allowing patient and relatives to understand what is happening and what to expect when away from medical professionals. Preparation is of utmost importance to be able to answer questions and more importantly be aware of abnormal findings and understand possible causes, appropriate contact to pass information to, and actions to perform. Education in not just what the patient should do when they go home but what they may expect and likely to experience is very important. B. What did you learn from observation of Sim that will help you improve how you care for clients in the future? (Must have a minimum of 5 complete sentences) Preparedness, communication, education, and consideration are the cornerstones of what is necessary for any medical professional to have and be proficient in when talking to patients and their families. In “real world” setting I would want to gather as much information as I could about the patient before walking in the room from round handoffs or EMR to be as prepared as possible. I am going to speak to and make eye with everyone in the room to provide respect, calmness, and at the same time access any communication barriers, acquire a sense of tension or ease. I will ask, often, about patients’ comfort and about their guests comfort as well. I will also enquire if anyone has any questions about either about what actions I’m performing or anything that they’ve experienced. I would also inform them about how to care for themselves while they are both in the hospital and after they go home. I would also try to determine the availability of a support system and if they may need access to any services. C. Discuss how you were able to provide feedback to a peer: 1)How did the you handle the situation? 2) Was it professional? Support your conclusion with examples. 3) What changes would you make to providing feedback to peers in the future? (Must have a minimum of 5 complete sentences) I provide honest and empathic observations with details about specific actions or communication. I told my partner that I thought they were very well prepared and were able to answer all my questions and concerns. They did not become flustered or aggravated even when I would ask questions during the answering of my previous question. My partner provided a relaxed comfortable atmosphere that was better than many of the visits and births of my actual children. The tone of voice, subject matter expertise, and total care that was provided was exceptional and allowed for my own concerns to be lifted and made me feel as if I was heard, understood, and respected. Then because of all that I was much more confident in our care and outcome even outside of the facility. I don’t really know if I would plan on providing feedback any differently.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
