What is Hypertension • Term to refer to high blood pressure • Risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke • Normal • Less than 120/80 mm Hg • Elevated • 120-129/80 mm Hg • Hypertension • Stage 1 • 130-139/80-89 mm Hg • Stage 2 • Greater or equal to 140/90 mm Hg This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY. Pathophysiology of Hypertension • Heart pumps-forces blood through vessels • Pressure exerted on vessel walls-measured as blood pressure • Blood pressure-determined by: • Cardiac Output (CO) • Physical and emotional activities-increase CO • Peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) • Anything causing narrowing vessels-increases PVR • Nervous system causing vasoconstriction-increases PVR • Blood volume (BDV) • Hormones that increase sodium retention-increases BDV • Decreased kidney function-increases BDV Types of Hypertension • Chronic elevation of unknown cause Primary (Essential Hypertension) • Elevation from known cause • Treat unknown cause-Blood pressure usually returns to normal Secondary Dora • Dora's blood pressure is 154/96 at the clinic. The provider explains her blood pressure reflects a primary stage 2 hypertension. • The provider leaves the room and ask you, what is primary hypertension and what is stage 2? • What do you tell her? • What is the difference between Stage 1 and 2? List signs and symptoms of hypertension This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Signs and Symptoms of Hypertension \"Silent Killer\" Often diagnosed when seeking care for other reasons S/S • Headache • Bloody nose • Dizziness • Visual disturbances • Ankle and sacral edema Target Organ Disease- Damage to • Blood Vessels of Heart • Kidney • Brain • Eyes Diagnosis of Hypertension Risk Factors Presence of S/S History of kidney or heart disease Use of medication Blood Pressure Readings • Home Blood Pressure Measurements • Average BP for two or more readings on different dates, greater than 139/89 • ECG, blood glucose, HCT, KCL, Ca, cholesterol level Identify causes and risks factors for hypertension This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Risk Factors for Hypertension-Nonmodifiable • Family history (twice the risk) • Age (plaque builds up in arteries) • Diabetes (family history with obesity) • Ethnicity • African Americans higher risk • Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone • Increased renin activity...greater sodium and fluid retention • Body-Fluid Volume • Diuretics-hydrochlorothiazide; furosemide (Lasix) Risk Factors for Hypertension-Modifiable • Decrease sodium • 1500 mg per day-(Average American 3400 mg per day) • Healthy diet and lifestyle • Weight-BMI/sodium/fats • 2000 calories per day • Increase activity • Decrease peripheral resistance • Decrease body fat. • 30 minutes a day every day • Stop smoking • Nicotine constricts the blood vessels. • Decrease alcohol intake and stress • Adequate sleep Am I at Risk for Hypertension? Gloria, 34 year old, single female in graduate school studying effects of hypertension on children, states she is \"living her best life\" Marsha, 45 year old married female, works as elementary school teacher, best friend has hypertension and counseling her on benefits of healthy lifestyle Richard, 65 year old married male, retired from banking, both parents have history of hypertension, stopped smoking 10 years ago Andrew, 35 year old male, never been married, healthcare administrator of major healthcare organization, wants to implement measures to reduce hypertensive in elderly population Foods to Avoid-High in Sodium • Tomato juice • Canned vegetables • Frozen vegetables • Cheese • Salted crackers/bread • Canned fish/meats/soups • Ham, lunch meats • Fast food • Catsup This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC. Rhymes with \"said\" Great with sauerkraut! College students often live on this type of \"soup\" You \"can't just eat one\" Rhymes with \"lake\" and is one of Mrs. X's favor-\"ates\" Mustard's friend Pepper's other \"half\" Type of sauce that might have scales and fins Type of drink in most elementary school lunch- boxes \"Mmmm good\" that's what ____ is Describe therapeutic measures for hypertension This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Acute phase of Hypertension • Intake and output hourly • Weigh patient daily • Medications-observe side effects • Monitor-dependent edema • Observe-bed rest complication • Turn, cough, deep breath • Antiembolism stockings • Provide-emotional support • Provide-low sodium diet, possibly restrict fluids • Educate-diet, medication, and activity This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Treatments-Antihypertensive Medications • Diuretics-Increases urine output by balancing sodium and water by kidney • Thiazide and Thiazide-like Diuretics • Give with food • Monitor Intake and Output • Assess edema • Monitor electrolytes • Educate to take during waking hours-prevent night urination • Hydrochlorothiazide- monitor potassium, blood glucose may increase in diabetics, hypercalcemia with digoxin • Loop Diuretic • Acts on ascending loop of Henle in kidney-causes sodium and water loss, potassium, magnesium, and calcium • Furosemide (Lasix) • Contraindicated if allergic to sulfonamides • Monitor potassium • Educate: take with food or milk • Use sunscreen to prevent photosensitivity This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Treatments- Antihypertensive Medications • Diuretics-Increases urine output by balancing sodium and water by kidney • Potassium-sparing diuretics • Mild diuretic-causes sodium and water loss and potassium retention by kidney • Amiloride (Midamor) • Monitor potassium • Check blood pressure prior to administering This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND. Treatments-Antihypertensive Medications • Sympatholytic (Beta Blockers)-Decreases sympathetic nervous system response • Ends in OLOL • Decreases blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, conduction • Assess: Heart rate, blood pressure-can cause bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension • Assess I&O and weight • Monitor for bronchospasm • Educate: • Rise slowly • Do not stop medication abruptly-may cause hypertension, angina, arrhythmias • Atenolol (Tenormin) • Metoprolol (Lopressor) • Metoprolol (Toprol XL) • Propranolol (Inderal) This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC.
