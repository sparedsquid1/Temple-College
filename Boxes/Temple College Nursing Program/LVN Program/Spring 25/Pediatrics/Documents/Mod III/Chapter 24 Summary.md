### **Complete Summary of Chapter 24: The Child with a Musculoskeletal Condition**

---

## **1. Overview of the Musculoskeletal System**

- The **muscular and skeletal systems** work together for **support and movement**.
- Develops from the **mesoderm** between **weeks 4-8 of fetal life**.
- **Locomotion** follows a **gradual, orderly process**.

### **Differences Between Pediatric and Adult Bones**

- **Not fully ossified** (more flexible).
- **Thicker periosteum** (faster healing).
- **Lower mineral content** (stronger but prone to epiphyseal plate fractures).
- **Epiphyseal plate fractures** can affect **growth**.

### **Observations for Musculoskeletal Health**

- **Spinal curvature** changes:
    - Newborn: **C-shaped spine**
    - Childhood: **S-shaped spine**
- **Gait assessment**.
- **Muscle tone** evaluation.
- **Neurological exam** and **diagnostic tests**.

---

## **2. Pediatric Trauma**

### **Soft Tissue Injuries**

- **Contusions** (bruising).
- **Sprains** (ligament injury).
- **Strains** (muscle/tendon injury).

### **Types of Fractures**

- **Simple**: Bone breaks cleanly.
- **Compound**: Bone pierces the skin.
- **Greenstick**: Incomplete break (common in children).
- **Complete**: Bone fully broken into two parts.
- **Spiral**: Twisting force fracture (associated with **child abuse**).

---

## **3. Traction in Pediatric Care**

**Purpose**: To align bones, reduce pain, and immobilize the extremity.

### **Types of Traction**

1. **Bryant’s Traction**: For children <2 years with femur fractures or hip dysplasia.
2. **Buck’s Traction**: Stabilizes hip/femur fractures before surgery.
3. **Russell’s Traction**: Used for **knee injuries** and **femur fractures**.
4. **Skeletal Traction**: Involves **pins** inserted into the bone.

### **Traction Checklist**

- Weights **hanging freely**.
- **No knots resting against pulleys**.
- **Bed linens do not interfere** with traction.
- **Countertraction maintained**.

---

## **4. Casts and Splints**

- Used for immobilization and healing.

### **Risks Associated with Casts**

1. **Skin breakdown**.
2. **Compartment syndrome**:
    - Increased pressure from swelling **compromises circulation**.
    - **Signs**: Unrelieved pain, numbness, pallor, weak pulses.
    - **Treatment**: Fasciotomy (surgical release of pressure).

### **Nursing Care for a Child in a Cast**

- **Elevate extremity**.
- **Frequent neurovascular checks**.
- **Teach cast care (e.g., signs of looseness/tightness, safe transfers, crutch use)**.

---

# **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

---

### **1. A child with osteomyelitis should avoid which activity?**

- A. Running
- B. Non-weight-bearing ✅
- C. Physical therapy
- D. Swimming

**Rationale:** **Osteomyelitis** is a bone infection requiring **immobilization** to prevent **pain and worsening infection**. **Weight-bearing is restricted** until the infection resolves.

---

### **2. Which symptom suggests compartment syndrome?**

- A. Mild discomfort
- B. Weak pulses ✅
- C. Swelling relieved by elevation
- D. Minor bruising

**Rationale:** **Weak or absent pulses, severe pain, and pallor** suggest **compartment syndrome**, a medical emergency caused by **increased pressure cutting off circulation**.

---

### **3. Which intervention is essential for a child in traction?**

- A. Keep weights touching the bed
- B. Maintain countertraction ✅
- C. Loosen ropes for comfort
- D. Elevate the affected limb

**Rationale:** **Countertraction (opposing force)** is necessary to **maintain alignment and healing**. Weights should **hang freely** without touching the bed.

---

- A. Early walking milestones
- B. Hypertrophied calf muscles ✅
- C. Increased muscle strength
- D. Decreased cognitive function

**Rationale:** In **DMD**, calf muscles appear **enlarged (hypertrophied)** due to **fat and connective tissue replacing muscle fibers**.

---

### **5. A child is diagnosed with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Which nursing instruction is correct?**

- A. Encourage active weight-bearing exercises
- B. Provide NSAIDs and bed rest
- C. Maintain non-weight-bearing status ✅
- D. Encourage high-impact sports

**Rationale:** **Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease** involves **avascular necrosis of the femoral head**, requiring **non-weight-bearing to promote healing**.

---

### **6. A parent asks how to prevent osteomyelitis in a child. The best response is:**

- A. "Ensure proper wound care after injuries." ✅
- B. "Encourage increased calcium intake."
- C. "Have the child avoid physical activity."

**Rationale:** **Proper wound care** prevents bacteria from **entering the bloodstream** and infecting the bone.

---

### **7. A child with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is experiencing a flare-up. Which intervention is most beneficial?**

- A. Encourage complete bed rest
- B. Apply moist heat packs ✅
- C. Administer aspirin on an empty stomach

### **8. What is the best position for a child post-scoliosis surgery?**

- A. High Fowler’s position
- B. Prone with knees flexed
- C. Flat with logrolling for movement ✅
- D. Side-lying with legs bent

**Rationale:** **Post-scoliosis surgery**, the child should remain **flat** with **logrolling for movement** to maintain **spinal alignment**.

---

### **9. A child is diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma. Which statement by the parent indicates understanding of treatment?**

- A. "My child will need amputation."
- B. "Radiation and chemotherapy are common treatments." ✅
- C. "No treatment is necessary unless symptoms worsen."
- D. "Surgery is the only treatment option."

**Rationale:** **Ewing’s sarcoma** is typically treated with **radiation and chemotherapy**, not amputation.

---

### **10. Which intervention is most important for a child wearing a Milwaukee brace for scoliosis?**

- A. "Wear the brace 8 hours a day."
- B. "Apply lotion under the brace to prevent irritation."
- C. "Wear a cotton T-shirt under the brace." ✅
- D. "Avoid all physical activity while wearing the brace."

**Rationale:** A **cotton T-shirt under the brace** prevents **skin irritation**.

---

### **11. A nurse is caring for a child in Buck’s traction. Which action is incorrect?**

- A. Ensuring weights hang freely
- B. Checking neurovascular status regularly
- C. Removing traction weights for comfort ✅

- A. Assess the child’s understanding of the procedure ✅
- B. Encourage immediate weight-bearing
- C. Teach that pain will not be an issue
