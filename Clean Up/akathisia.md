**Akathisia** is a movement disorder characterized by an intense feeling of restlessness and an overwhelming urge to move, typically affecting the legs. People with akathisia may find it difficult to sit still, often feeling compelled to pace, fidget, or shift their weight from one leg to the other. This condition is often distressing and can significantly impact a person's quality of life.

### Causes of Akathisia

Akathisia is most commonly associated with the use of certain medications, particularly:

1. **Antipsychotic Medications:** Especially first-generation (typical) [[Antipsychotics]] like [[haloperidol]] and [[chlorpromazine]], and to a lesser extent, second-generation (atypical) [[Antipsychotics]] like [[risperidone]] and [[Olanzapine]].
   
2. **Antidepressants:** Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other types of antidepressants can cause akathisia, especially when starting treatment or increasing the dosage.
   
3. **Anti-nausea Medications:** [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like [[metoclopramide]], which are used to treat nausea and gastrointestinal conditions, can also induce akathisia.

4. **Other Medications:** Certain medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, and some antihistamines or [[Calcium channel blockers]], may also be associated with akathisia.

### Symptoms of Akathisia

Symptoms can vary in intensity and may include:

- **A strong urge to move:** Constantly needing to walk, pace, or shift position.
- **Inner restlessness:** A feeling of [[anxiety]] or discomfort that compels movement.
- **Inability to sit still:** Difficulty remaining seated, often accompanied by leg movements like tapping, swinging, or shifting weight.
- **Irritability or agitation:** The restlessness can cause emotional distress, leading to irritability or [[anxiety]].

### Types of Akathisia

1. **Acute Akathisia:** Develops shortly after starting or increasing the dose of a medication. It can last for days to weeks.
  
2. **Chronic Akathisia:** Persists for longer periods, often months or even years, especially if the causative medication is not discontinued or adjusted.
  
3. **Tardive Akathisia:** A form of akathisia that develops after long-term use of antipsychotic medications, sometimes appearing even after the medication has been stopped.
  
4. **Withdrawal Akathisia:** Occurs when a medication that has been controlling the symptoms is reduced or discontinued.

### Diagnosis of Akathisia

- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:** Diagnosis is primarily based on the patient's history and the presence of characteristic symptoms. A thorough review of medications is essential.
  
- **Differential Diagnosis:** Other conditions that may cause restlessness, such as [[anxiety disorders]], Parkinson's disease, restless legs syndrome, or other movement disorders, need to be ruled out.

### Treatment of Akathisia

1. **Medication Adjustments:**
   - **Dose Reduction:** Reducing the dose of the offending medication or switching to a different drug with a lower risk of causing akathisia.
   - **Drug Discontinuation:** Stopping the medication, if possible, may alleviate symptoms.

2. **Adjunctive Medications:**
   - **Beta-blockers (e.g., [[propranolol]]):** Often used to reduce symptoms of akathisia.
   - **[[Benzodiazepines]] (e.g., [[clonazepam]]):** Can help alleviate restlessness and [[anxiety]].
   - **Anticholinergics (e.g., benztropine):** Sometimes used, particularly if there are other extrapyramidal symptoms.
   - **[[amantadine]] or [[mirtazapine]]:** May be effective in some cases.

3. **Non-Pharmacological Approaches:**
   - **Behavioral Therapy:** Techniques to help manage the psychological distress associated with akathisia.
   - **Exercise:** Physical activity may help reduce the urge to move by providing an outlet for restlessness.

### Prognosis

The outlook for akathisia varies depending on the cause and treatment. Acute akathisia may resolve with appropriate medication adjustments, while chronic or tardive akathisia can be more challenging to manage and may persist even after stopping the causative medication. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes and minimizing distress for the patient.
