Disulfiram is a medication used primarily in the treatment of [[Alcohol]] use disorder. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of [[Alcohol]] metabolism. When someone consumes [[Alcohol]] after taking disulfiram, it leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body. This buildup results in unpleasant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and flushing. These effects, known as the disulfiram-[[Alcohol]] reaction, serve as a deterrent to drinking [[Alcohol]], as the individual experiences immediate discomfort.

The medication works as a conditioning agent, pairing the act of drinking [[Alcohol]] with negative consequences. This conditioning aims to reduce the desire to drink by creating an aversion to [[Alcohol]]. Disulfiram is typically used in conjunction with counseling and support programs to help individuals abstain from [[Alcohol]] over the long term.

In summary, disulfiram functions by blocking the breakdown of acetaldehyde, causing unpleasant physical effects when [[Alcohol]] is consumed. This method is intended to discourage [[Alcohol]] consumption and support efforts to maintain sobriety in individuals with [[Alcohol]] use disorder.
