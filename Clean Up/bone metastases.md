Bone [[mets]] occur when cancer cells spread from their original (primary) site to bone. This is a common event in advanced stages of various cancers, such as breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancers. Here are key aspects of bone [[mets]]:

1. **Pathophysiology**:
    - **Mechanism**: Cancer cells detach from the primary tumor, travel through the bloodstream or [[Lymphatic system]], and establish new tumors in [[Bone Tissue]].
    - **Common Sites**: Spine, pelvis, ribs, skull, and long bones of the arms and legs.

2. **Symptoms**:
    - **Bone Pain**: The most common symptom, often worsening at night or with activity.
    - **Fractures**: Bones weakened by [[mets]] can break more easily.
    - **Hypercalcemia**: Elevated calcium levels in the [[Blood]], leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and fatigue.
    - **Nerve Compression**: If the metastasis compresses spinal nerves, it can cause pain, numbness, or paralysis.

3. **Diagnosis**:
    - **Imaging**: X-rays, bone scans, CT scans, MRI, and PET scans to detect bone lesions.
    - **Biopsy**: To confirm the diagnosis and identify the type of cancer cells.
    - **[[Blood]] Tests**: To check for elevated calcium levels and other abnormalities.

4. **Treatment**:
    - **Medications**: 
        - Bisphosphonates and [[denosumab]] to strengthen bones and reduce pain and fractures.
        - Pain management with [[Analgesics]], including [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]], opioids, and [[Corticosteroids]].
        - Hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy, depending on the primary cancer type.
    - **Radiation Therapy**: To reduce pain and control tumor growth in bones.
    - **Surgery**: To stabilize bones or repair fractures.
    - **Palliative Care**: To improve quality of life and manage symptoms.

5. **Prognosis**:
    - Bone [[mets]] indicate advanced cancer and often affect prognosis. The goal of treatment is typically to manage symptoms, maintain function, and improve quality of life.

Early detection and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial for managing bone [[mets]] effectively.
