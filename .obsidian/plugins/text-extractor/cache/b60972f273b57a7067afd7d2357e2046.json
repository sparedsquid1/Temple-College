A client with thyrotoxicosis is prescribed levothyroxine. The nurse would prioritize which finding on assessment? A) Tachycardia B) Agranulocytosis C) Loss of hair D) Skin rash Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should monitor for tachycardia, palpitations, headache, nervousness, insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, fatigue, sweating, and flushing as adverse reactions after administering levothyroxine to a client with thyrotoxicosis. Agranulocytosis, loss of hair, and skin rash are not the adverse reactions to levothyroxine; they are adverse reactions found in a client receiving methimazole.

A nurse is preparing to administer levothyroxine to a client who is also prescribed citalopram. The nurse predicts which assessment finding may occur in this client? A) Prolonged bleeding B) Decreased effectiveness of the thyroid drug C) Increased risk of paresthesias D) Increased risk of hypoglycemia Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should monitor for a decreased effectiveness of the thyroid drug as the result of the interaction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram. When the client is receiving oral anticoagulants with thyroid hormones, the client is at risk of prolonged bleeding. Increased risk of hypoglycemia occurs when oral hypoglycemics and insulin are administered with thyroid hormones to the client. The nurse should observe for paresthesias as one of the adverse reactions in a client receiving antithyroid drugs.

A nurse is preparing to administer liothyronine to a client with chronic thyroiditis. The nurse determines the drug needs to be administered cautiously after noting which disorder in the client's medical history? A) Upper respiratory tract infection B) Diabetes C) Elevated body temperature D) Cardiac disease Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should be cautious about existing conditions such as cardiac disease and also cautious about lactating clients before administering liothyronine to clients with chronic thyroiditis. The nurse need not be cautious about administering liothyronine to clients with an upper respiratory tract infection, diabetes, or elevated body temperature. The nurse should be cautious about clients contracting an upper respiratory tract infection on administrating antithyroid drugs. A client with diabetes may experience an increase in diabetes while undergoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The nurse should observe for elevated body temperature while managing the needs of a client administered thyroid hormones.

A health care provider has prescribed methimazole for an elderly client with hyperthyroidism who lives alone. Which potential nursing diagnosis should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Disturbed thought processes related to adverse drug reactions B) Risk for ineffective health management C) Risk for infection related to adverse drug reactions D) Risk for impaired skin integrity related to adverse reactions Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should prioritize risk for ineffective health management for this client. The client with hyperthyroidism may be concerned with the results of medical treatment and with the problem of taking the drug at regular intervals around the clock. Risk for infection related to adverse drug reactions and risk for impaired skin integrity related to adverse reactions could also be appropriate for this client receiving antithyroid drugs; however, not the priority. Disturbed thought processes may apply for a client receiving ACTH.

A client with hyperthyroidism, who is prescribed methimazole, reports a skin rash to the nurse. Which instruction should the nurse prioritize when assessing the client? A) Offer suggestions to alter the drug schedule. B) Instruct the client to avoid applying lubricants. C) Instruct the client to use soap sparingly. D) Check if discoloration of the hair occurs. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to use soap sparingly, if at all, and apply soothing creams or lubricants until the rash subsides. The dosing may need to be changed and the rash should be reported immediately to the health care provider. The nurse need not offer suggestions to alter the drug schedule, instruct the client to avoid applying lubricants, or check if discoloration of hair occurs.

A client presents to the emergency department with an apparent reaction to recently started thyroid therapy. Which assessment finding would lead the nurse to question that this client is experiencing a thyroid storm? A) Memory impairment B) Cold intolerance C) Constipation D) Altered mental status Answer: D Rationale: Some clients will experience an increase in hyperthyroidism rather than decrease during therapy. When these symptoms occur rapidly, it is termed a thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm. It is characterized by high fever, extreme tachycardia, and altered mental status. Memory impairment, cold intolerance, and constipation are the manifestations of myxedema, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism.

A client presents to the health care provider's office with reports of worsening hypothyroidism symptoms in spite of taking the prescribed levothyroxine. When questioned about medication changes, the client tells the nurse that they were recently prescribed an antidepressant by another health care provider. Which antidepressant(s) does the nurse suspect the client has started? Select all that apply. A) Amitriptyline B) Quetiapine C) Sertraline D) Fluoxetine E) Topiramate Answer: C, D Rationale: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline and fluoxetine, can decrease the effectiveness of levothyroxine, leading to the reappearance of hypothyroidism symptoms in clients previously controlled on a dose of levothyroxine. Other categories of antidepressants such as amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) will increase the effectiveness of the thyroid drug. There are no apparent interactions between levothyroxine and quetiapine (antipsychotic) or topiramate (anticonvulsant). Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 42 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 569, Interactions 16. A client prescribed treatment for atrial fibrillation is now prescribed levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. The nurse prepares to monitor the client for increased cardiac dysfunction if the client is prescribed which current medication(s)? Select all that apply. A) Lisinopril B) Digoxin C) Diltiazem D) Metoprolol E) Warfarin Answer: B, D Rationale: A client with a heart condition controlled on digoxin and metoprolol must be monitored closely by the nurse for worsening atrial fibrillation if levothyroxine is initiated due to decrease effectiveness of digoxin and β-blockers (metoprolol). There are no recognized reactions when lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) or diltiazem (calcium channel blocker) are used with thyroid replacements. The use of warfarin (anticoagulant) with levothyroxine may result in prolonged bleeding.
