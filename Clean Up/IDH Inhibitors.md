**IDH inhibitors** are a class of [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] designed to target and inhibit the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, which are genes encoding these enzymes, are often found in various types of cancers, including certain brain tumors (like gliomas) and [[Blood]] cancers (like acute myeloid [[Leukemia]], or [[acute myelocytic leukemia]]). These mutations lead to the production of an oncometabolite called 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which can interfere with cellular metabolism and contribute to cancer development.

**Interactions:**
- IDH inhibitors work by specifically targeting the mutant forms of the IDH enzyme, thereby reducing the levels of 2-HG in the body. Lowering 2-HG levels can help to reverse the abnormal cellular processes driven by the mutation and potentially slow down or halt tumor growth.

**Approved IDH Inhibitors:**
- **[[ivosidenib]] (Tibsovo):** Targets IDH1 mutations. It has been approved for the treatment of [[acute myelocytic leukemia]] with a susceptible IDH1 mutation.
- **[[enasidenib]] (Idhifa):** Targets IDH2 mutations. It is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory [[acute myelocytic leukemia]] with a susceptible IDH2 mutation.

**Clinical Uses:**
- IDH inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of cancers with confirmed IDH mutations, particularly [[acute myelocytic leukemia]]. Ongoing research is exploring their use in other cancers where IDH mutations are present, such as gliomas.

**Side Effects:**
- Common side effects of IDH inhibitors can include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated [[Liver]] enzymes. Some patients may also experience differentiation syndrome, a potentially serious condition related to the rapid maturation of [[Leukemia]] cells.

These inhibitors represent a targeted therapy approach in oncology, offering a personalized treatment option based on the genetic profile of the tumor.
