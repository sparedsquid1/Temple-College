How long after the vaccination should the nurse instruct the client to wait before getting pregnant? A)\t2 weeks B)\t4 weeks C)\t8 weeks D)\t12 weeks Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to wait at least 12 weeks (3 months) before getting pregnant after receiving measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines. Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because of the danger of birth defects in the infant. Following vaccination with these agents, the client is advised to wait for 12 weeks before getting pregnant.

On assessment, the nurse discovers that the child had received an antivenin injection for a snake bite 2 days before. When should the nurse instruct the caregivers to return for this vaccine for this child? A)\tAfter 1–2 weeks B)\tAfter 3–4 weeks C)\tAfter 4–5 weeks D)\tAfter 6–8 weeks Answer: D Rationale: Live attenuated vaccines should be administered to clients after 6–12 weeks of administration of immune globulin preparation. MMR vaccine, being a live attenuated vaccine, should be administered to the child after 6–12 weeks, as the child has received immune globulin for a snake bite. Vaccinations containing live organisms are not administered within 6–12 weeks of immune globulin administration because antibodies in the globulin preparation may interfere with the immune response to the vaccination. To obtain an effective immune response to vaccination, the live vaccine has to be administered 14–30 days before or 6–12 weeks after immune globulin administration.

The nurse would prioritize the assessment for indications of which adverse reaction? A)\tLymphoma B)\tAngioneurotic edema C)\tAcute renal failure D)\tReye syndrome Answer: D Rationale: When salicylates are administered along with the varicella vaccine, there is an increased risk of development of Reye syndrome. It is often associated with children who are given aspirin-containing medicines while they have chickenpox (varicella). Lymphoma, angioneurotic edema, and acute renal failure do not develop with the simultaneous administration of salicylates and the varicella vaccine. Lymphoma is a contraindication for receiving some vaccines. Angioneurotic edema is a sign of hypersensitivity to a substance. IGIV products have been associated with acute renal failure and should be used cautiously in clients with renal disease.

The instructor determines the session is successful when the students correctly choose which type of immunity as developing after the use of ready-made antibodies from animals? A)\tActive immunity B)\tCell-mediated immunity C)\tHumoral immunity D)\tPassive immunity Answer: D Rationale: The nurse is referring to passive immunity. The injection of ready-made antibodies found in the serum of immune individuals or animals is called passive immunity. When a person is exposed to antigens, the body begins to form antibodies. This is called active immunity. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity involve the action by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes.

The nurse predicts the health care provider will prescribe which vaccine for this client? A)\tMMR vaccine B)\tVaricella vaccine C)\tRotavirus vaccine D)\tRabies vaccine Answer: D Rationale: Due to the high numbers of animals in the forest, the ranger should receive the rabies vaccine as prophylaxis as they are at a high risk for contracting the virus. The MMR vaccine is used in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. The varicella vaccine is used in preventing chickenpox, and the rotavirus vaccine is used in preventing gastroenteritis caused by the rotavirus.

Which drug does the nurse predict the client will be given as treatment? A)\tAntivenin B)\tToxoid C)\tVaccine D)\tImmune globulins Answer: A Rationale: Antivenin of Micrurus fulvius is used in passive transient protection from the toxic effects of the venom of the coral snake found in the United States. The most effective response is obtained when the drug is administered within 4 hours of exposure. Vaccines, toxoids, and immune globulins are examples of immunologic agents and are not used in treating a snake bite.

The nurse prepares to administer the injection at which site? A)\tRight arm B)\tLeft arm C)\tRight leg D)\tLeft leg Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should use the dominant arm, in this case, the right arm, for the injection to help aid in the absorption. Question format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 47 Learning Objective: 6 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 642, Acute Pain \t10.\tThe immediate reactions usually occur within 30 minutes of administration of the antivenin. The antivenins may cause various reactions, with hypersensitivity being the most severe. Symptoms include apprehension; flushing; itching; urticaria; edema of the face, tongue, and throat; cough; dyspnea; vomiting; cyanosis; and collapse. A)\tRisk for infection B)\tAcute pain C)\tHyperthermia D)\tIneffective coping Answer: B Rationale: The client who is receiving an immunization would most likely experience pain at the injection site; therefore, acute pain would be most appropriate. If the drug were not given, then the client would be at risk for infection. Although fever may occur, hyperthermia as a nursing diagnosis would be inappropriate. Ineffective coping would not be associated with immunologic agents.

The instructor determines the session is successful when the students correctly choose which example(s) to differentiate artificially acquired active immunity from other types? Select all that apply. A)\tAn individual who is exposed to chickenpox for the first time and has no immunity to the disease B)\tAdministration of the varicella vaccine to an individual who has no immunity to the disease C)\tAn individual who is exposed to pertussis for the first time and has no immunity to the disease D)\tAdministration of the influenza vaccine to an individual who has no immunity to the disease E)\tAdministration of the rubella vaccine to an individual who has no immunity to the disease Answer: B, D, E Rationale: Artificially acquired active immunity occurs when an individual is given a killed or weakened antigen in the form of a vaccine, which stimulates the formation of antibodies against the antigen. The antigen does not cause the disease, but the individual still manufactures specific antibodies against the disease. Administration of the varicella vaccine, administration of the influenza vaccine, and administration of the rubella vaccine to an individual who has no immunity to the disease are examples of artificially acquired active immunity. Naturally acquired active immunity occurs when the person is exposed to and experiences a disease and the body manufactures antibodies to provide future immunity to the disease. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 47 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Understand Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 636, Artificially Acquired Active Immunity \t13.\tA nurse is assessing a client's medical record and determines that the client has naturally acquired active immunity. Which example(s) would most likely apply? Select all that apply. A)\tExperiencing chickenpox results in immunity to the disease B)\tAdministration of the varicella vaccine protects against varicella C)\tAfter recovering from pertussis, the client demonstrates immunity against repeat exposures D)\tFaithfully reporting to the clinic for the influenza vaccine every year E)\tAdministering the rubella vaccine at routine well-baby visits Answer: A, C Rationale: Naturally acquired active immunity occurs when the person is exposed to and experiences a disease and the body manufactures antibodies to provide future immunity to the disease. This would be an individual who is exposed to chickenpox or pertussis for the first time and has no immunity to the disease. Artificially acquired active immunity occurs when an individual is given a killed or weakened antigen, which stimulates the formation of antibodies against the antigen. The antigen does not cause the disease, but the individual still manufactures specific antibodies against the disease. Administration of a vaccine to an individual who has no immunity would be an example of artificially acquired active immunity.

Select all that apply. A)\tAn individual who is exposed to chickenpox for the first time and develops the disease B)\tAdministration of botulism immune globulin to an infant C)\tAn individual develops pertussis after exposure from a sibling D)\tAdministration of Crotalidae polyvalent immune fab for the treatment of a rattlesnake bite E)\tAdministration of the first dose of rubella vaccine to an infant Answer: B, D Rationale: Passive immunity occurs when immune globulins or antivenins are administered. This type of immunity provides the individual with ready-made antibodies from another human or an animal. Administration of botulism immune globulin for the treatment of infant botulism or administration of Crotalidae polyvalent immune fab for the treatment of mild to moderate North American rattlesnake bites are examples of passive immunity. Active immunity occurs when the person is exposed to a disease, develops the disease, and then the body makes antibodies to provide future protection against diseases such as chickenpox and pertussis. The use of vaccines is also a form of active immunity as it provides the antibodies for the body to utilize to prevent the disease, such as with rubella. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 47 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Understand Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 637, Passive Immunity \t15.\tA nurse is teaching a client about the use of immune globulins. The nurse determines the session is successful when the client can successfully point out which fact(s) about immune globulins? Select all that apply. A)\tAre proteins present in serum or plasma that contain antibodies B)\tAre given to provide active immunity against disease C)\tCan be obtained from human and animal blood D)\tReceive antibodies only to the diseases to which donor blood is immune E)\tOnset of protection is rapid with a duration of 6–12 months Answer: A, C, D Rationale: The following is true in regard to the use of immune globulin: globulins are proteins present in blood serum or plasma that contains antibodies; globulins are given as passive immunity against disease; immune globulin can be obtained from human and animal blood; clients receiving immune globulins receive antibodies only to the diseases to which donor blood is immune; and the onset of protection is rapid but the duration of action is short (1–3 months).
