PARP (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase) inhibitors are a class of targeted cancer therapies that interfere with DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are particularly effective in treating cancers with defects in specific DNA repair pathways, such as those associated with [[BRCA1]] and BRCA2 mutations.

### Key Concepts:

- **PARP Enzymes:** PARP enzymes, especially PARP-1, play a crucial role in repairing single-strand DNA breaks through a process called base excision repair. When DNA damage occurs, PARP detects the damage and adds poly (ADP-ribose) chains to various proteins, recruiting DNA repair machinery to the site of the break.

- **DNA Repair Pathways:** Cells have multiple mechanisms to repair DNA damage. In addition to base excision repair, another key pathway is homologous recombination (HR), which repairs double-strand breaks. [[BRCA1]] and BRCA2 are critical components of the HR pathway.

### Interactions:

- **Inhibition of PARP:** PARP inhibitors, such as **[[olaparib]] (Lynparza)**, **[[rucaparib]] (Rubraca)**, and **[[niraparib]] (Zejula)**, block the activity of PARP enzymes. This prevents the repair of single-strand DNA breaks, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage.

- **Synthetic Lethality:** In cells with functional HR (e.g., those without BRCA mutations), the cell can repair the more severe DNA damage caused by PARP inhibition. However, in cells with [[BRCA1]] or BRCA2 mutations, the HR pathway is defective, meaning these cells rely heavily on PARP to repair DNA. When PARP is inhibited in these cells, the accumulation of DNA damage becomes catastrophic, leading to cell death. This phenomenon, where the combination of two genetic defects (e.g., BRCA mutation and PARP inhibition) leads to cell death, is known as **synthetic lethality**.

### Clinical Applications:

- **BRCA-Mutated Cancers:** PARP inhibitors are particularly effective in treating cancers that harbor [[BRCA1]] or BRCA2 mutations, such as certain breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers.

- **Ovarian Cancer:** PARP inhibitors have been approved as maintenance therapy for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, extending progression-free survival.

- **Breast Cancer:** [[olaparib]] and other PARP inhibitors are used in the treatment of BRCA-mutated, [[HER2-positive breast]]-negative metastatic breast cancer.

- **Other Cancers:** Research is ongoing to explore the use of PARP inhibitors in other cancer types, including prostate and pancreatic cancers, especially in patients with specific genetic mutations.

### Side Effects and Considerations:

- **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, fatigue, anemia, [[thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), and [[neutropenia]] (low neutrophil count) are common side effects of PARP inhibitors. Gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue are also frequently reported.

- **Resistance:** Cancer cells can develop resistance to PARP inhibitors through various mechanisms, such as restoring HR function or losing PARP-1 itself. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is an active area of research.

- **Combination Therapy:** To overcome resistance and enhance efficacy, PARP inhibitors are sometimes used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other targeted therapies.

### Summary:

PARP inhibitors represent a significant advancement in the treatment of certain cancers, particularly those with BRCA mutations. By exploiting the weaknesses in the DNA repair mechanisms of cancer cells, these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] offer a more targeted and potentially less toxic alternative to [[Traditional Chemotherapy]]. However, their use requires careful consideration of potential side effects, resistance, and the specific genetic makeup of the cancer.
