Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. This condition can cause sudden [[Vision]] loss, often in one eye, and is often accompanied by pain, especially when moving the eye. 

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden [[Vision]] loss in one eye
- Pain with eye movement
- Loss of color [[Vision]]
- Flashing lights

**Causes:**
- Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common associated condition.
- Infections (e.g., viral infections like measles, mumps, herpes)
- Autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus)
- Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)
- Certain medications and toxins

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical examination by an ophthalmologist or neurologist
- Visual acuity tests
- Color [[Vision]] tests
- Visual field tests
- MRI of the brain and orbits
- [[Blood]] tests and lumbar puncture (in some cases)

**Treatment:**
- [[Corticosteroids]] to reduce inflammation
- Treating underlying conditions (e.g., MS management)
- Pain management

**Prognosis:**
- [[Vision]] often begins to improve within a few weeks.
- Some patients may experience long-term effects, such as reduced color [[Vision]] or contrast sensitivity.
- Recurrences are possible, especially in patients with underlying conditions like MS.
