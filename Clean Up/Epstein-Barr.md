aliases:
  - EBV

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpesvirus family and one of the most common human viruses. It is best known for causing infectious mononucleosis, often referred to as "mono" or the "kissing disease." EBV is highly prevalent, and most people are infected with it at some point in their lives.

### Transmission:
- **Saliva:** The most common way EBV is transmitted is through saliva, which is why it's often associated with kissing. It can also be spread by sharing drinks, [[Eating]] utensils, or personal items like toothbrushes.
- **[[Blood]] and organ transplant:** Though less common, the virus can be spread through [[Blood]] transfusions and organ transplants.
- **Perinatal transmission:** Pregnant women can occasionally pass the virus to their babies during childbirth, though this is rare.

### Symptoms:
- **Infectious Mononucleosis:** This is the most well-known condition caused by EBV. Symptoms typically include:
  - **[[Fever]]**
  - **Sore throat**
  - **Swollen lymph nodes:** Especially in the neck and armpits.
  - **Fatigue:** Can be prolonged, lasting weeks or even months.
  - **Enlarged spleen:** Some people may experience spleen enlargement, which requires careful monitoring to avoid rupture.
  - **Rash:** Occasionally, people might develop a rash, especially if they have taken certain antibiotics like [[amoxicillin]] or [[ampicillin]].

### Associated Conditions:
- **Chronic active EBV:** In rare cases, the infection can become chronic, leading to persistent symptoms.
- **Cancers:** EBV has been associated with several types of cancer, including Burkitt's [[Lymphoma]], Hodgkin's [[Lymphoma]], and nasopharyngeal [[Carcinoma]].
- **Autoimmune diseases:** There is evidence suggesting a link between EBV and certain autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] ([[systemic lupus erythematosus]]).

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Blood]] tests:** Tests can detect antibodies against EBV, indicating current or past infection. These include the heterophile antibody test (monospot test) and specific EBV antibody tests (e.g., EBV viral capsid antigen or EBV nuclear antigen).
- **Complete [[Blood]] count (CBC):** Often shows atypical lymphocytes and elevated white [[Blood]] cell count during active infection.

### Treatment:
- **Supportive care:** Most EBV infections, including mononucleosis, are self-limiting and require only symptomatic treatment, such as rest, hydration, and pain relievers (like [[acetaminophen]] or [[ibuprofen]]).
- **Avoid physical activities:** If the spleen is enlarged, it is crucial to avoid contact sports or heavy lifting to prevent spleen rupture.
- **Antiviral medications:** These are generally not effective against EBV in most cases of mononucleosis. However, they may be used in severe or chronic cases under specific circumstances.

### Prevention:
- **Hygiene:** Since EBV is spread through saliva, avoiding sharing personal items and close contact with infected individuals can reduce the risk of transmission.

### Prognosis:
Most people recover fully from an EBV infection, though the fatigue can linger for an extended period. Once infected, the virus remains in the body in a dormant state and can occasionally reactivate without causing symptoms.
