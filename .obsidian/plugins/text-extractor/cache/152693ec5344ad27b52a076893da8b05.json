ABOUT NCLEX PROGRAM OVERVIEW In April 1994, nurse licensure candidates began taking the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX®) on computers at test centers located across the United States (U.S.) and select international sites. The change to computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for the nurse licensure examination came about as a result of a decision made in August 1991 by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN®). The NCLEX is only provided in the CAT format. The NCLEX is administered on a computer. An on-screen calculator will be available during the examination. NCLEX items have multiple formats. Candidates can familiarize themselves with the different NCLEX item types and the computer software by taking the tutorial at www.nclex.com/prepare.htm. There is partial credit scoring for items for which more than one key exists. There will be three methods for scoring items for partial credit: plus/minus, zero/one and rationale scoring. The detailed information can be found at https://www.ncsbn.org/publications/NGN-News-Summer-2021. The NCLEX is designed to test knowledge, skills and abilities essential to the safe and effective practice of nursing at the entry level. Both the NCLEX-RN ® and the NCLEX-PN ®* are a variable-length, computerized, adaptive tests. The NCLEX is not offered in paper- and-pencil or oral examination formats. The NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN can be anywhere from 85 to 150 items. Regardless of the number of items administered, the time limit for this examination is five hours. It is important to note that the time allotted for the includes the introductory screen, all breaks (restroom, stretching, etc.) and the examination. All breaks are optional. NCLEX results are an important component used by nursing regulatory bodies (NRBs) to make decisions about licensure/ registration. Only NRBs can release NCLEX results to candidates. *The NCLEX-PN is used for U.S. licensure only. 2 REGISTERING FOR THE EXAM NCLEX® REGISTRATION PROCESS OVERVIEW 1.

If you decide to submit an additional registration, first stop payment on the original payment, verify the stop-payment was processed, then contact Pearson VUE at the appropriate number listed on page 1 of this bulletin. Additionally, there will be no refund of the international scheduling fee or VAT for any reason. Failure to Pay A candidate may not take the NCLEX if the registration fee has been stopped either by the candidate or a financial institution. If payment is stopped after the candidate takes the examination, NCSBN and the nursing regulatory bodies (NRBs) reserve the right to hold and/or cancel the candidate’s result. Registration Time Limit All NCLEX registrations will remain open for a 365-day time period during which a nursing regulatory body (NRB) can determine a candidate’s eligibility. This time period begins when the NRB receives the candidate’s NCLEX registration from the test service. Once a candidate is made eligible, he or she must test within the validity dates printed on the Authorization to Test (ATT). Candidates who are not made eligible or are denied eligibility by their NRB within the 365-day time period will forfeit their NCLEX registration, including the registration fee. Candidates who wish to take the NCLEX will need to reregister and pay another examination fee. You must wait until your current registration expires before reregistering. A candidate may not have two NCLEX registrations (of the same exam type) open at the same time. 3 HOW TO REGISTER FOR THE NCLEX 1.

TESTING ACCOMMODATIONS Testing accommodations for otherwise qualified candidates can be provided only with the authorization of your nursing regulatory body (NRB). • Request information from your NRB concerning its requirements for receiving testing accommodations. This should be done before submitting your NCLEX registration to Pearson VUE. • Make a written request for accommodations to your NRB. Your request must comply with requirements established by your NRB for candidates requesting testing accommodations. • Send your request to your NRB as early as possible so that, if approved, the testing accommodations can be made in a timely manner. Do not schedule an appointment to take the NCLEX until you have received written confirmation of your accommodations and your Authorization to Test (ATT) email listing the granted accommodations. Online Scheduling Option: If you have been approved for any of the following accommodations (and no additional ones), you may schedule your appointment online at www.PearsonVUE.com/nclex • Extra time – 30 minutes • Extra time – 1 hour • Extra time – 2 hours • Extra time – 3 hours Candidates approved for all other testing accommodations must schedule their testing appointment by calling Pearson VUE NCLEX Candidate Services at the telephone number listed on their ATT and asking for the NCLEX Accommodations Coordinator. Candidates with accommodations cannot cancel their accommodations at the time of their appointment. 4 SCHEDULING YOUR EXAM AUTHORIZATION TO TEST (ATT) After your nursing regulatory body (NRB) declares you eligible, you will receive your ATT email. You must have your ATT to schedule an appointment to take the NCLEX. If the name on your ID does not match exactly the first and last names you provided when registering (as listed on your ATT), you will not be admitted to the examination and will be required to reregister and pay another exam fee to take the examination. • The ATT email contains your authorization number, candidate identification number and an expiration date. • The ATT is valid for a period of time specified by the NRB (the average length of an ATT is 90 days). • Once the NRB declares you eligible to test and your ATT is issued by email, you must test within the validity dates of your ATT. • The ATT validity dates cannot be extended for any reason. If you do not test within these dates you will have to reregister and pay another examination fee. YOUR EXAM APPOINTMENT Test centers may fill up quickly because of high volumes and previously scheduled special events. Waiting to schedule your testing appointment may significantly limit the selection of dates from which you can choose to schedule. Additionally, if you wait until your Authorization to Test (ATT) is close to expiring, the test center may not be able to seat you prior to its expiration. If this occurs, you will be required to reregister and pay another examination fee. First-time test takers will be offered an appointment within 30 days of the call, or online attempt, to schedule an appointment; repeat candidates will be offered an appointment after 45 days. If you fail to arrive for your examination appointment or fail to reschedule/unschedule without giving the appropriate notice (as outlined on page 6), you will forfeit your examination fee (and scheduling fee if applicable) and your ATT will be invalidated. You will be required to reregister and pay another examination fee. Your failure to take the examination will be reflected in your registration as a case report that will be viewable by your NRB. Pearson VUE will not be held responsible for expenses incurred beyond the cost of the exam, including but not limited to travel expenses and lost wages on the day of the exam.

Please also be aware that the list of available international test centers is subject to change without prior notice. You will be notified in the event that the test center at which you are scheduled to take your examination becomes unavailable. You may reschedule the examination at another available test center.

Strict candidate identification requirements have been established. When you arrive at the test center, you will be required to present one form of acceptable identification. Your identification must match exactly the first and last names you provided when registering. If your acceptable ID does not match exactly the first and last names you registered with you will be turned away and required to reregister and pay another examination fee. If you paid the additional international scheduling fee, that will be forfeited as well. Acceptable Forms of Identification All forms of identification must be valid and meet the following requirements. If the ID does not meet these requirements, you will be turned away and required to reregister and pay another examination fee: • Government-issued • Non-expired • Physical (Non-digital) • Name (in Roman characters) • Recent photograph • Signature Examples of acceptable forms of identification for domestic test centers are: • Passport books and cards • Driver’s license • Provincial/territorial or state identification card • Permanent residence card • Military identification card The only identifications acceptable for international test centers, including Puerto Rico, are: • Passport books and cards If your ID does not contain a signature but meets all other ID requirements listed above you must bring in a secondary form of identification to the test center. The signature on your secondary ID must match exactly with the first and last name on your primary ID and with the names that you provided when you registered. The secondary identification must contain: • Signature (in Roman characters) PLEASE NOTE: Any ID that is clipped, perforated, cracked, broken or otherwise altered is invalid and will be treated as expired. IDENTIFICATION FROM A U.S. - SANCTIONED (EMBARGOED) COUNTRY Due to U.S. trade restrictions, candidates who indicate that they live in a sanctioned country are unable to be admitted to sit for the NCLEX. This is a federal requirement by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. In order to be admitted to the NCLEX, candidates who hold a passport from a sanctioned country must also present proof of residency (government - issued identification) from a non sanctioned country. This only applies to candidates presenting a passport from a sanctioned country. Please visit the acceptable ID web page for the most up-to-date information on the U.S. - Sanctioned Countries Identification Policy. YOUR NAME The first and last names printed on your identification must match exactly the first and last names you registered with. If the names with which you have registered are different from the names on your identification, you must bring legal name change documentation with you to the test center on the day of your test. The only acceptable forms of legal documentation are: a marriage license, divorce decree and/or a court action legal name change document. All documents must contain the name change in Roman characters and must be the original documents. Candidates wishing to make a name change, address change or email address change must contact their nursing regulatory body. This cannot be done at the test center. If the name on your identification does not match the name you registered with, you will be turned away and will have to reregister and pay another examination fee. 78 TEST SITE RULES AND REGULATIONS NCLEX Examination Candidate Rules To ensure that all candidates’ NCLEX results are earned under comparable conditions and represent fair and accurate measurement, it is necessary to maintain a standardized testing environment. The following regulations are designed to help ensure such an environment. You will provide a digital signature agreeing to the full list of candidate rules presented to you at the time of testing (current version at time of publication on pages 9-10), in addition to agreeing to NCSBN’s biometric policy as outlined here: https://policies.ncsbn.org/biometric_data_policy.html. GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL OR CANCELLATION OF RESULTS A candidate who violates the test center regulations or rules, or engages in irregular behavior, misconduct and/or does not follow the test administrator’s (TA’s) warning to discontinue inappropriate behavior may be dismissed from the test center, and his or her exam fee will not be refunded. Additionally, your exam result may be withheld or canceled, and your nursing regulatory body may take other disciplinary action such as denial of a license/registration and/or disqualifying you from future registrations for licensure/ registration. Behaviors that constitute irregular behavior or misconduct include but are not limited to: • Giving or receiving assistance of any kind. • Using, accessing or attempting to access any prohibited aids. Prohibited aids are any devices or materials that will be helpful in taking the NCLEX. Examples of aids that are prohibited are electronic devices (e.g, cell/mobile/smart phones, tablets, smart watches), handheld calculators, conversion tables, and dictionaries. • Attempting to take the examination for someone else. • Bringing any NCLEX study aids (textbooks, notebooks, classroom notes, etc.) to the testing center or accessing or attempting to access such study materials at any time after the start of the examination administration, including break times. • Failing to follow testing regulations or the instructions of the TA. • Creating a disturbance of any kind. • Tampering with the operation of the computer or attempting to use it for any function other than taking the examination. CONFIDENTIALITY Candidates should be aware and understand that the disclosure of examination items before, during, or after the examination is a violation of law. Violations of confidentiality and/or candidates’ rules can result in criminal prosecution or civil liability and/or disciplinary actions by the licensing agency including the denial of licensure. If you are aware of, or have observed an attempt to compromise the NCLEX process, please report it to the NCLEX Test Security group. Candidates may report any suspicious behavior in the following ways: Call NCSBN at 1.866.293.9600 (toll-free) or email examssecurity@ncsbn.org. TEST SECURITY NCSBN strives to report results that accurately reflect the ability of each test taker. Accordingly, our standards and procedures for administering exams have two related goals: giving test taker comparable opportunities to demonstrate their abilities and preventing any test taker from gaining an unfair advantage over others. To promote these objectives, NCSBN reserves the right to cancel or withhold any test results when, in its judgment, a testing irregularity occurs; there is an apparent discrepancy in, or falsification of, a test taker’s identification; a test taker engages in misconduct or irregular behavior violates the candidate rules or otherwise breaches his/her Confidentiality Agreement; or the results are believed to be invalid for any other reason, notwithstanding the absence of any evidence of a candidate’s personal involvement in irregular activities. INVALID RESULTS NCSBN may cancel or withhold a candidate’s results if, in NCSBN’s judgment, there is a basis to question the validity of the results for any reason, notwithstanding the absence of any evidence of a candidate’s personal involvement in irregular activities. Evidence of invalid results may include, but is not limited to, unusual answer patterns or unusual score increases from one exam to another. If a candidate’s result is canceled or invalidated without finding that the candidate engaged in irregular behavior, the candidate may appeal the decision and may be offered a free retest. An appeal is the candidate’s exclusive means of redress with regard to NCSBN’s decision to take this action. 9 NCSBN Examination Candidate Rules NCSBN Examination Candidate Rules 5.6 CONFIDENTIAL January 2023 Si vous voulez lire les règles en français, veuillez en faire la demande à l’administrateur de l’examen.

The TA will resume the exam for you upon your return. • Lanyard policy: The TA will attach a lanyard to your locker key. The lanyard must remain visible during the break. REPORTING EXAMINATION CONCERNS If you have any problems or complaints regarding the examination or its administration, please call Exam Candidate Services toll free at 1-866-496-2539, or email info@ncsbn.org, within 14 days of your examination. Exam data is encrypted and transferred electronically to your nursing regulatory body. Please refrain from asking the TA about exam content and/or results. If you have questions about the examination, please contact NCSBN at info@ncsbn.org. 11 THE DAY OF THE EXAM The staff members at each test center follow designated procedures to ensure that the operation of the test center meets NCSBN criteria for standardized testing. The following are procedures that will be adhered to when you arrive at the test center for your NCLEX appointment. CHECK-IN PROCESS Plan to arrive at the test center at least 30 minutes before your scheduled testing time. If you arrive more than 30 minutes after your scheduled appointment, you may be required to forfeit your NCLEX appointment. Your failure to take the examination will be reflected in your registration as a case report, which will be viewable by your nursing regulatory body (NRB). • You will be required to present a valid acceptable ID. • You will be asked to provide your digital signature and a palm vein scan, and you will have your photograph taken. • Hats, scarves and coats may not be worn in the testing room or while your photograph is being taken. You will be asked to remove any watches, large jewelry, or other accessories before entering the testing room. • You will be required to place all electronic devices in a Pearson VUE-provided sealable bag to be placed in the lockable storage provided to you for the duration of the examination appointment. • Friends, relatives or children who accompany you to the test center are not allowed to wait in the test center while you take the examination. • You will be required to leave your personal belongings outside the testing room. Secure storage will be provided; however, candidates are not allowed to access any of the prohibited personal items at any time during the exam, including breaks. Storage space is small, so candidates should plan appropriately. Test centers assume no responsibility for candidates’ personal belongings. • The test administrator (TA) will give you a short orientation and then will escort you to a computer terminal. You must remain in your seat during the examination, except when authorized to leave by test center staff. You may not change your computer terminal unless a TA directs you to do so. • Please reference the Test Site Rules and Regulations listed on page 8 for additional information on the check-in process. Raise your hand to notify the TA if you: • Believe you have a problem with your computer. • Need to change note boards. • Need to take a break. • Need the TA for any reason. • Have completed your exam. BREAKS • You will have up to five hours to complete the NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN examinations; total examination time includes a short introductory screen, two preprogrammed optional breaks and any unscheduled breaks you may take. • The first optional break is offered after two hours of testing. The second optional break is offered after three and one-half hours of testing. • The computer will automatically tell you when these scheduled breaks begin. • You must leave the testing room during both scheduled and unscheduled breaks. • It is strongly advised that you not leave the test center during breaks. • When you take a break, all personal items accessed (including purses, wallets, etc.) may be inspected by the test administrator. • Any tampering of the electronic device bag provided at check-in will be reported. This could result in the cancellation of your examination results. • You will be required to provide a palm vein scan before and after your break. Candidates are not allowed to access any of the prohibited personal items during breaks (including but not limited to those listed on page 9–10). All breaks count against testing time. 12 TECHNICAL ISSUES Occasionally, technical problems may require rescheduling of a candidate’s examination. If circumstances arise causing you to wait more than 30 minutes after your scheduled appointment time, or a restart delay lasts longer than 30 minutes, you will be given the choices of continuing to wait or rescheduling your appointment without an additional fee. • If you choose to wait, you may change your mind at any time prior to beginning or restarting the examination. • If you choose not to reschedule but rather test after a delay, you will have no further recourse and your exam results will be considered valid. • If you choose to reschedule your appointment or the problem causing the delay cannot be resolved, you will be allowed to test at a later date, at no additional charge. Every attempt will be made to contact candidates if technical problems are identified prior to a scheduled appointment. TESTING ENVIRONMENT Testing centers administer many types of examinations including some that require essay-type responses. Test centers have no control over noises made by candidates typing during another examination. Typing noise is considered a normal part of the computerized testing environment, just as the noise of turning pages is a normal part of the paper-and-pencil testing environment. Earplugs are available from the test administrator upon request. You may not bring your own earplugs. WHEN THE EXAM IS FINISHED After your examination is finished, you will be asked to complete a brief computer-delivered questionnaire about your testing experience. When you have finished the questionnaire, raise your hand to summon the test administrator (TA). The TA will collect and inventory your note board. If you have electronic devices in a Pearson VUE-provided bag, you must take the bag to the TA to be inspected and opened. Removal of devices by the candidate will result in a case report and could lead to the cancellation of your examination result. The TA will dismiss you when all requirements are fulfilled. If you believe there was an irregularity in the administration of your exam or the associated test conditions that you believe adversely affected the outcome of your examination, you should notify the proctor or TA before you leave the test center. RESULTS REPORTING For quality control purposes, every NCLEX is scored twice; once by the computer at the test center and then the result is verified after the examination record has been transmitted to Pearson VUE. Although the examination is scored as the candidate completes each item, no results are released at the test center. In fact, test center staff do not have access to the examination results. Examination results are available only from the nursing regulatory bodies (NRBs) and will be sent to candidates up to six weeks after taking the examination (this time period varies across NRBs). Do not call Pearson VUE NCLEX Candidate Services, the test center or NCSBN for examination results. If more than six weeks have passed and you have not received your results, contact your NRB. You can also get your“unofficial” results after 2 business days through the quick results service available through your candidate profile. Quick results are not available in all states and there is a minimal fee for this service. For a list of nursing regulatory bodies that participate in quick results, please visit https://www.nclex.com/quick-results.htm. The Quick Results service is not available for candidates seeking licensure/registration in Canada or Australia. CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE REPORT When a candidate fails, the nursing regulatory body (NRB) sends the candidate a Candidate Performance Report (CPR). This report identifies the performance as failing, specifies the number of items administered to the candidate and provides a summary of the candidate’s relative strengths and weaknesses based on the test plan. This CPR is intended for failing candidates to use to help guide their study before retaking the examination. 13 RETAKE POLICY The NCSBN retake policy allows candidates to take the NCLEX eight times a year, and there must be 45 test-free days between each examination. This is unless the desired jurisdiction of licensure/registration only offers a limited number of NCLEX exams per year. Candidates are encouraged to contact the NRB for their policy on NCLEX retakes. SUBMITTING COMMENTS AND FURTHER QUESTIONS You may ask the test administrator for a Confidential Comment Sheet to provide any information about your exam appointment to NCSBN, the test centers or Pearson VUE NCLEX Candidate Services. If you have questions about your testing session, please contact NCSBN within two weeks of your exam appointment. NCLEX CONTENT, TEST DEVELOPMENT AND TEST PLANS EXAM CONTENT The practice of nursing requires knowledge of the health needs of clients as well as an understanding of integrated processes fundamental to nursing practice. Client Needs are used as the framework for both RN and PN test plans. NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN examinations may include items written at various cognitive levels. 1, 2 The majority of items are written at the application or higher levels of cognitive ability. In general, if the age or age category of the client is not stated in an item, it can be understood that the client is an adult. 1 Bloom, B.S. (ed). (1956).

DEVELOPING THE NCLEX The NCLEX is developed using the following steps: 1. To determine the basis for safe and effective entry-level nursing practice, NCSBN conducts a practice analysis of entry-level nurses every three years. The legal scope of nursing practice and results of the practice analysis are used to develop an NCLEX test plan. During alternate years, NCSBN conducts the Continuous Practice Analysis to validate the existing NCLEX Test Plan. If significant changes in entry-level practice are noted, the findings are forwarded to the NCSBN Board of Directors for further direction. Test plans, which outline the content categories and percentage of exam items allocated to the categories, reflect the job-related knowledge, skills and abilities required for safe and effective entry-level job performance. 2. Item writers are nursing instructors who write items that test entry-level nursing practice for the RN or PN examination. 3. A second expert panel of practicing nurses then reviews the newly-written items. The second review is to ensure that each item reflects current entry-level nursing practice and that it is accurate. 4. All items used in an examination have been pretested and are shown to have met NCSBN statistical criteria before being used as operational (scored) items. DEFINITIONS Client = Individual, family or group which includes significant others and population. Clinical judgment = The observed outcome of critical thinking and decision-making. It is an iterative process with multiple steps that uses nursing knowledge to observe and assess presenting situations, identify a prioritized client concern and generate the best possible evidence-based solutions in order to deliver safe client care. The Clinical Judgment steps include recognize cues, analyze cues, prioritize hypotheses, generate solutions, take action and evaluate outcomes. NCLEX Integrated Processes = Themes such as the nursing process, caring, communication, documentation, teaching, learning, clinical judgment, culture and spirituality are fundamental to the practice of nursing and are integrated throughout the Client Needs categories and subcategories. Prescription = Orders, interventions, remedies or treatments ordered or directed by an authorized health care provider. Order: Intervention, remedy or treatment as directed by an authorized primary health care provider. Prescription: Intervention as it relates to medication specifically as directed by an authorized primary health Exhibit = Denotes a client chart or medical record type of item. Additional information is available behind tabs listed on the screen. Click on a tab to review the additional information. 14 Primary Health Care Provider = Members of the health care team who are licensed and authorized to formulate prescriptions and orders on behalf of the client, as well as receive notifications of client status, are referred as primary health care provider, medical physician (or other specialty, e.g., surgeon, nephrologist) or an advanced practice nurse. Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP) = Any unlicensed personnel trained to function in a supportive role, regardless of title, to whom a nursing responsibility may be delegated. NCLEX TEST PLANS The NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN Test Plans are documents that describe the scope and content of the examinations. The NCLEX Test Plans can be downloaded at no cost on the NCLEX website at: www.nclex.com/test-plans.htm. CLIENT NEEDS CATEGORIES COVERED ON THE NCLEX The content of the 2023 NCLEX-RN® Test Plan and the 2023 NCLEX-PN® Test Plan is organized into four major Client Needs categories. Two of the four categories are divided into subcategories. The 2019 NCLEX-RN Test plan is effective April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2026 and the 2020 NCLEX-PN is effective April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2026. The following processes are integrated into all Client Needs categories of the RN and PN Test Plan; Nursing Process, Caring, Communication and Documentation, Teaching and Learning, and Culture and Spirituality. In addition to the Client Needs categories and subcategories listed below, clinical judgment processes are explicitly measured by 18 case study items (i.e., three item sets) and approximately 10% stand-alone items, which will be selected depending on exam length. For the 2023 NCLEX-RN Test Plan NCLEX-RN Client Needs Percentage of Items from Each Category/ Subcategory Safe and Effective Care Environment • Management of Care • Safety and Infection Control 15-21% 10-16% Health Promotion and Maintenance 6-12% Psychosocial Integrity 6-12% Physiological Integrity • Basic Care and Comfort • Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies • Reduction of Risk Potential • Physiological Adaptation 6-12% 13-19% 9-15% 11-17% For the 2023 NCLEX-PN Test Plan NCLEX-PN Client Needs Percentage of Items from Each Category/ Subcategory Safe and Effective Care Environment • Coordinated Care • Safety and Infection Control 18-24% 10-16% Health Promotion and Maintenance 6-12% Psychosocial Integrity 9-15% Physiological Integrity • Basic Care and Comfort • Pharmacological Therapies • Reduction of Risk Potential • Physiological Adaptation 7-13% 10-16% 9-15% 7-13% NCLEX PSYCHOMETRICS COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TESTING (CAT) The NCLEX is different from a traditional pencil-and-paper examination. Typically, pencil-and-paper examinations administer the same items to every candidate, thus ensuring that the difficulty of the examination is the same across the board. Because the difficulty of the examination is constant, the percentage correct is the indicator of the candidate’s ability. One disadvantage of this approach is that it is inefficient. It requires the high-ability candidates to answer all the easy items on the examination, which provides very little information about their ability. PRETEST ITEMS For CAT to work, the difficulty of each item must be known in advance. The degree of difficulty is determined by administering the items as pretest items to a large sample of NCLEX candidates. Because the difficulty of these pretest items is unknown, these items are excluded when the computer is estimating the candidate’s ability or making pass-fail decisions. When enough responses are collected, the pretest items are statistically analyzed and calibrated. If the pretest items meet the NCLEX statistical standards, they can be administered in future examinations as scored items. ITEM FORMATS Each NCLEX candidate is provided information on how to answer examination items. A tutorial is available to all candidates prior to examination day. The tutorial explains the various item formats that candidates may see on the examination. More detailed information about the NCLEX examination, including information on the Next Generation NCLEX, CAT methodology, the candidate bulletin and tutorials, can be found at the website NCLEX.com. A more detailed description of the item types can be found in the NCLEX Tutorial section on the website A short tutorial explaining how to answer each of the alternate types of items can be found at www.nclex.com/prepare.htm. 15 Another disadvantage is that guessing can artificially inflate the scores of low ability candidates, because they can answer these items correctly 25 percent of the time for reasons that have nothing to do with their ability. Instead, the NCLEX uses Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to administer the items. CAT is able to produce exam results that are more stable using fewer items by targeting items to the candidate’s ability. The goal of CAT is to determine the ability of the candidate in relation to the passing standard. Every time the candidate answers an item, the computer re-estimates the candidate’s ability. With each additional answered item, the ability estimate becomes more precise. 1. The item is limited to the content area that will produce the best match to the test plan percentages. It is ensured that each candidate’s exam has enough questions from each content area to match the required test plan percentages. Regarding clinical judgment items, three case study sets and approximately 10% stand-alone items will be selected depending on the exam length. 2. An item or item set is selected that the candidate is expected to find challenging. Based on the candidate’s answers up to that point and the difficulty of those items, the computer estimates the candidate’s ability and selects an item or item set that the candidate should have a 50% chance of answering correctly. This way, the next item or item set should not be too easy or too hard and the examination can get maximum information about the candidate’s ability from the item or item set. 3. Excludes any item or item set that a repeat candidate has seen in the previous examinations. NCLEX PASS OR FAIL DECISION RULES The decision as to whether a candidate passes or fails the NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN examination is governed by three different scenarios. Scenario # 1: The 95% Confidence Interval Rule This scenario is the most common for NCLEX candidates. The computer will stop administering items when it is 95% certain that the candidate’s ability is either clearly above or clearly below the passing standard. Scenario #2: Maximum-Length Exam Some candidate’s ability levels will be very close to the passing standard. When this is the case, the computer continues to administer questions until the maximum number of items is reached. At this point, the computer disregards the 95% confidence interval rule and considers only the final ability estimate: • If the final ability estimate is at or above the passing standard, the candidate passes. • If the final ability estimate is below the passing standard, the candidate fails. Scenario #3: Run-Out-of-Time Rule (R.O.O.T.) If the candidate runs out of time before reaching the maximum number of items, the computer has not been able to decide whether the candidate passed or failed with 95% certainty. Therefore, an alternate rule must be used: • If the candidate has not answered the minimum number of items, the result will be a failing exam. • If the candidate has answered the minimum number of items, then the exam is scored by using the final ability estimate computed from the responses to all completed items. n If the final ability estimate is at or above the passing standard, the candidate passes. n If the final ability estimate is below the passing standard, the candidate fails. THE PASSING STANDARD The NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN are separate examinations that reflect different scopes of practice. Accordingly, these examinations are scored on separate scales and have respective passing standards. The NCSBN Board of Directors reevaluates these standards once every three years for each exam. The criterion that the Board of Directors uses to set the standard is the minimum level of ability required for safe and effective entry-level nursing practice. To assist the Board of Directors in making this decision, the Board is provided with information on: (1) the results of a standard setting exercise performed by a panel of experts with the assistance of psychometricians; (2) the historical record of the passing standard with summaries of the candidate performance associated with those standards; (3) the results of a standard setting survey sent to educators and employers; and (4) information describing the educational readiness of high school graduates who express an interest in nursing. Once the passing standard is set, it is imposed uniformly on every exam record according to the procedures laid above. To pass the NCLEX, a candidate must perform at or above the passing standard. There is no fixed percentage of candidates that pass or fail each examination. SIMILAR ITEMS Occasionally, a candidate may receive an item that seems to be very similar to an item they received earlier in the examination. This could happen for a variety of reasons. For example, several items could be about similar symptoms, diseases, or disorders, yet address different phases of the nursing process. Alternatively, a pretest (unscored) item could appear to have content similar to an operational (scored) item. It is incorrect to assume that a second item, which is similar in content to a previously administered item, is administered because you answered the first item incorrectly. Always select the answer you believe to be correct for each item administered. All examinations conform to their respective test plan (NCLEX-RN or NCLEX-PN). GUESSING Rapid guessing can drastically lower your score. Some test preparation companies have realized that on certain paper-and- pencil tests, unanswered items are marked as wrong. To improve the candidate’s score when they are running out of time, these companies sometimes advocate rapid guessing (perhaps without even reading the item) in the hope that the candidate will get at least a few items correct. On any adaptive test, this can be disastrous. It has the effect of giving the candidate easier items, which lowers the candidate ability estimate further. The best advice is to: (1) maintain a reasonable pace (spending no more than one to two minutes on each item), and (2) carefully read and consider each item before answering. 16 111 E.
