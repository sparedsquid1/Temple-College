HER2-positive breast cancer is a type of breast cancer where the cancer cells have higher than normal levels of a protein called human [[EGFR Inhibitors]] 2 (HER2). This protein promotes the growth of cancer cells. HER2-positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer, but treatments that specifically target HER2 have improved outcomes significantly.

### Key Points:
- **HER2 Protein:** HER2 is a protein that can affect the growth of some cancer cells. It is found on the surface of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] breast cells, but in HER2-positive breast cancer, there are more copies of the HER2 [[gene]] (HER2/neu) than normal, leading to excess production of the HER2 protein.
  
- **Aggressiveness:** HER2-positive breast cancers tend to grow faster and are more likely to spread than HER2-negative cancers. However, they are also more likely to respond to targeted therapies.

- **Treatment Options:** The main treatments include targeted therapies such as [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin), [[pertuzumab]], and newer [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like T-DM1 (ado-[[trastuzumab]] emtansine). These treatments are often combined with chemotherapy. Hormone therapy might also be used if the cancer is hormone receptor-positive.

- **Prognosis:** With the advent of HER2-targeted therapies, the prognosis for HER2-positive breast cancer has improved significantly, with many patients responding well to treatment.

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential for managing this type of breast cancer.
