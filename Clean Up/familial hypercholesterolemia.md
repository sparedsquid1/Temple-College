Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by extremely high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, in the [[Blood]]. This condition significantly increases the risk of developing early cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and [[Heart]] attacks.

Key features of familial hypercholesterolemia include:

1. **Genetic Inheritance**: FH is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered [[gene]] from either parent can cause the condition. There are two forms:
   - **Heterozygous FH**: Inherited from one parent, resulting in LDL cholesterol levels that are elevated but not as high as in the homozygous form.
   - **Homozygous FH**: Inherited from both parents, leading to even higher LDL cholesterol levels and a greater risk of early cardiovascular disease.

2. **LDL Receptor Dysfunction**: The most common cause of FH is a mutation in the LDLR [[gene]], which encodes the LDL receptor responsible for removing LDL cholesterol from the [[Blood]]. Mutations can also occur in other genes like APOB,  [[PCSK9 Inhibitors|PCSK9]], and LDLRAP1.

3. **Elevated Cholesterol Levels**: Individuals with FH typically have total cholesterol levels above 300 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol levels above 190 mg/dL. In homozygous FH, LDL levels can exceed 500 mg/dL.

4. **Early Cardiovascular Disease**: Due to the high levels of LDL cholesterol, individuals with FH are at a much higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. This includes coronary artery disease, [[Heart]] attacks, and strokes.

5. **Physical Manifestations**: Some individuals with FH may develop physical signs such as xanthomas (cholesterol deposits in the skin or tendons), xanthelasmas (cholesterol deposits around the eyes), and corneal arcus (a grayish-white ring around the cornea of the eye).

Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia is typically based on:

- **Family History**: A history of high cholesterol and early [[Heart]] disease in close relatives.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: [[Blood]] tests showing significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels.
- **[[genetic testing]]**: [[identification]] of mutations in genes associated with FH.

Treatment and management of FH focus on lowering LDL cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk, and may include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a [[Heart]]-healthy diet, increasing physical activity, avoiding smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight.
- **Medications**: Statins, [[ezetimibe]],  [[PCSK9 Inhibitors|PCSK9]] inhibitors, and other lipid-lowering medications are commonly prescribed. In severe cases, additional treatments like LDL apheresis (a procedure to remove LDL cholesterol from the [[Blood]]) may be necessary.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring of cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health.

Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial in managing familial hypercholesterolemia and reducing the risk of severe cardiovascular complications.
