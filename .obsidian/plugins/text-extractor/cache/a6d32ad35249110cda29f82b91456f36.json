might depend on hosts but can live and reproduce outside of host • Aerobic: need oxygen to live; found on skin • Anaerobic: can live without oxygen; found in GI tract • Rod-shaped: thick-walled spores; example includes c. diff., needs to be disinfected with bleach • Rickettsiae: vectors include living organisms; examples include typhus, scrub typhus, rocky mountain spotted fever ▪ Virus: smaller than bacteria; depend on host cells to live and reproduce; antiviral drugs only decrease symptoms ▪ Fungi: yeasts and molds; normal flora of mouth, vagina, intestinal tract; antifungal medications are available although serious fungal infections are rare ▪ Protozoa: single-celled parasitic organisms with flexible membranes and live in the soil ▪ Helminths: wormlike parasites; trichinosis is a disease transmitted by eating raw or undercooked meat of pigs or wild animals with the larvae ▪ Prion: proteins found mainly in the brain; long incubation periods, no inflammatory response; progress is rapid and can lead to death; example includes creutzfeldt-jakob disease o Reservoir: environmental home for infectious agent ▪ Animate: people, insects, animals, plants (living things) ▪ Inanimate: water, soil, medical devices (not living) o Portal of exit: path by which infectious agent leaves its reservoir o Mode of transmission ▪ Direct: direct contact or droplet spread through touching, kissing, or sex; examples include scabies, mononucleosis, pertussis, influenza, and STIs • PPE: gloves, surgical masks, goggles, gowns, shoe covers ▪ Indirect: can be vehicle-borne, vector-borne, or airborne • Vehicles: biologic procedures (blood/organs), soiled bedding, food, surgical instruments, toys, water, and wound dressings; examples include influenza, norovirus, hepatitis B; to prevent- hand hygiene, cleaning patient equipment per protocols, clean food and water • Vectors: through living source other than humans (fleas, mice, rats, mosquitos, and ticks); examples include lyme disease, malaria, plague, zika virus; to reduce- avoid infested areas, using insect repellants, and rodent control • Airborne: can be inhaled and deposited on host membranes; examples include measles, chickenpox, tuberculosis; to prevent- use a HEPA filter to filter tiny particles most efficiently o Must wear n95 mask o Portal of entry: respiratory tract, skin, mucous membranes, GI tract, GU tract, placenta ▪ Determining factors: host’s condition and virulence (ability to produce an infection o Susceptible host: occurs from defense breakdown; burns, chronic diseases, immunocompromised, invasive procedures, malnourishment, stress, very young or very old ▪ Watch for atypical signs of infection in older adults: behavioral changes, may not have a fever ❖ Body’s Defense Mechanisms o Skin and mucous membranes (1st line): pH is less than 7; body also has an abundance of microflora o Cilia: hairlike structures that line the mucous membranes of upper respiratory tract, trap dust, mucous, pus, and foreign particles and then push them up to pharynx with wavelike movements to be expectorated (coughing) o Gastric acid: pH of 1-5 destroys most organisms that enter stomach o Immunoglobulins: also called antibodies; protein particles made by plasma cells; antigens are markers on cell surface o Leukocytes and macrophages: 5 different types (page 88) ▪ Phagocytosis: when neutrophils and macrophages engulf and digest the foreign antigens o Lysozymes: bactericidal enzymes found in WBCs, tears, saliva, and sweat o Interferons: group of antiviral proteins that help destroy infected cells and may inhibit tumor cell growth o Inflammatory response: caused by pathogens, trauma, or other injuries to tissue; may or may not present with infection ▪ Vascular response: first step; local vasodilation (increased blood flow), redness and heat at injury which brings more plasma to area to nourish the tissue ▪ Inflammatory exudate: second step; increased permeability of blood vessels; possible swelling which can cause pain on nerve endings ▪ Phagocytosis and purulent exudate: final step; destruction of pathogen and their toxins by leukocytes through phagocytosis; pus may form which contains protein, cellular debris, and dead leukocytes o Immune system: body’s final defense; immune cells and lymphoid tissue ❖ Infectious diseases (infection: results when immune system protection fails) o Risk factors for infection: age, chronic diseases, dysphagia, environment, immobility, immunocompromised, instrumentation, incontinence, invasive procedures, malnutrition, medications o Localized infection: microbes in one specific area; pain, redness, swelling, warmth at site o Sepsis: “life threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection”; possible septic shock ▪ Watch for a decrease in blood pressure o Laboratory assessment: use of gram staining, C&S, antibody tests, CBC with differential, ESR ▪ Gram positive: will turn purple ▪ Gram negative: will turn pink ▪ Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: early screening test for inflammation o Immunity: ability of body to protect itself from diseases ▪ Natural: species specific ▪ Innate: hereditary/genetics ▪ Acquired: active or passive through exposure to organisms, vaccines, immunoglobulin injection o Disease examples ▪ Infectious mononucleosis: epstein-barr virus is usual cause (a herpes virus also known as the “kissing disease”) • Very contagious • Extreme fatigue, anorexia, chills, red sore throat, headache, high fever, enlarged lymph nodes, tonsils may have white coating • Important to intervene with symptom management and teaching about importance of resting ▪ Ebola: direct contact transmission • Use hand hygiene and special PPE • S/S: appear in 2-21 days (fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, unexplained bruising and bleeding) • Complications: joint and vision problems • Supportive care only ▪ Zika virus: transmitted by infected mosquitos • Use hand hygiene and contact precautions • S/S include fever, headache, rash, muscle/joint pain, conjunctivitis • Supportive care: acetaminophen, fluids, rest • Complications: Guillain-Barre syndrome, birth defects ❖ Infection control in health-care agencies o HAI: infection from care in a health agency ▪ Risk factors: host’s condition, multiple antibiotic therapy, high risk units, immunocompromised, ▪ Common pathogens: Escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa o Hand hygiene: with any patient contact, and always after glove use ▪ Lather for 20 seconds (hum happy birthday song 2 times) ▪ Interlace fingers, scrub nails against palms, rinse with fingers downward ▪ Dry with paper towels and turn off faucet with paper towel o Asepsis: freedom from organisms ▪ Medical asepsis: clean technique; reduce number of pathogens ▪ Surgical asepsis: sterile technique; area is free of microorganisms and spores; used with surgery and sterilization o Ultraviolent light: disinfects patient care areas and rooms after traditional cleaning; UV lights bounce and reflect light waves in minutes o Infection prevention (precautions- table 8.3 on page 94) ▪ Standard: use with all patients; blood, body fluids, body substances; hand hygiene always; may include gloves, gowns, goggles, masks, face shields ▪ Transmission-based: specific infectious diseases; use with standard precautions ▪ Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE): private room, gloves, gowns, always decontaminate equipment o Prevention of respiratory tract infections ▪ Risk factors: invasive tubes (endotracheal, nasotracheal, tracheostomy) ▪ Prevention: oral hygiene, coughing and deep breathing, VAP bundles o Prevention of GI tract infections (most common HAI) ▪ Risk factors: foley catheter ▪ Prevention: appropriate use, remove is unnecessary, intermittent catheterization, strict aseptic technique, secure tubing, closed system, keep bag below bladder level o Prevention of surgical wound infections o Prevention: sterile technique for dressing changes, monitor wound ❖ Antibiotic-resistant infections o Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ▪ Difficult to treat which leads to high mortality rate ▪ Treatment: vancomycin hydrochloride; will end up needing PICC ▪ Use contact precautions ▪ S/S: warm red bumps, fever, drainage o Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) ▪ Direct/indirect transmission ▪ Prevention: proper hand hygiene, restricting vancomycin use, teach about wiping front to back, isolating at home (having own toilet and not sharing it), flushing twice ▪ Difficult to treat ▪ Treatment: combo antibiotic therapy ▪ Isolation when hospitalized ❖ Treatment of infections: antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals o Monitor peak/trough levels (especially with vancomycin) ❖ Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: upset of natural gut microbiota which can be harmful after normal microflora is destroyed; inflammation due to toxin release; watery stools; usually resolves when antibiotic is stopped o Meds: ampicillin, cephalosporins, and clindamycin o Clostridium Difficile: gram positive; overgrowth with imbalanced gut; transmitted fecal-oral route ▪ Possibly leads to pseudomembranous colitis which is life-threatening ▪ Nursing care: hand washing with soap and water; stopping antibiotic ▪ Treatment: metronidazole (Flagyl) or vancomycin (Vancomycin) • Possible fecal microbiota transplant (when other treatment has failed) ❖ Nursing Process o Risk for infection r/t external factors: watch for fever if inflammatory response cannot be noted, monitor WBCs ▪ Respiratory: encourage fluids, deep breathing and pain relievers, provide oral care or suction, use sterile water, elevate HOB at least 30 degrees ▪ GI tract: encourage fluid intake to replace loss during fever or vomiting or diarrhea, teach hand hygiene with antimicrobial soap and water ▪ GU tract: only place foleys if completely necessary, use sterile technique for inserting and clean it 2x daily o Deficient knowledge r/t infection and treatment: educate about how to control the risk for infect and how to use antibiotics correctly, educate about side effects and adherence to treatment Chapter 18: Immune System Function, Assessment & Therapeutic Measures (6 questions) ❖ Immune system o Lymphoid organs, lymphocytes and WBCs, chemicals, lymphatic system (lymph, vessels, nodes, and spleen) o Antigens: chemical markers that identify cells ▪ Human cells have “self-antigens” ▪ If they’re foreign, they will not match and instead be destroyed o Lymphocytes ▪ Natural killer cells: patrol body and produce a quick attack; blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen; destroy pathogens and tumor cells ▪ T and B cells: specific immune responses; both come from red bone marrow then the T cells migrate to thymus and B cells mature in bone marrow then migrate to lymphatic tissue • T cells: thymus-derived • B cells: bone marrow-derived; memory cells ▪ Antibodies: immunoglobulins or gamma globulins; glycoproteins produced by plasma cells in response to foreign antigens; specific to one antigen • IgG: in blood and extracellular fluid or lymph; provides long-term immunity after vaccine or illness recovery; can cross placenta to provide passive immunity • IgA: in external secretions such as tears or saliva or other mucous membranes; provides passive immunity when breastfeeding • IgM: in blood or lymph; produced first during infection (IgG production follows) • IgD: B cells; antigen specific receptors on B lymphocytes • IgE: mast cells or basophils; important with allergic reactions as mast cells release histamine ▪ Immunity • Cell-mediated: against intracellular pathogens, malignant cells, and grafts of foreign tissue o Recognition of foreign antigen by helper T cells (CD4), killer T cells lyse cells (CD8), memory T cells remember specific antigens, suppressor T cells limit immune response • Humoral: “antibody-mediated”; against extracellular pathogens o B cells proliferate and differentiate, plasma cells produce antibodies that circulate forming an antigen-antibody complex, memory B bells, antibodies label antigen for phagocytosis o Antigen-antibody complex stimulates complement fixation, enzyme complex lyses cells and labels foreign antigens for phagocytosis ❖ Antibody responses o First exposure to foreign antigen stimulates antibody production in small amts o Second exposure causes memory cells to make large amounts of antibody o Vaccines are based on this principle o Allergic response: when antibodies respond to foreign but harmless antigens ▪ Teach about always carrying an epinephrine autoinjector and making sure it’s not out of date ❖ Types of immunity: o Passive: temporary; antibodies obtained outside person ▪ Naturally: placental transmission; antibodies in breastmilk ▪ Artificially: injection of performed antibodies o Active: production of own antibodies ▪ Naturally: recovery from disease; memory cells specific to pathogen ▪ Artificially: vaccines stimulate production of antibodies and memory cells; may allow lifelong immunity • Vaccines: provide artificially acquired immunity, stimulates production of small amounts of antibodies, stimulates production of memory cells ❖ Aging and the immune system o Immunosenescence: decline in immune system seen with older population ▪ Thymus gland decreases in size, increased production of immature T cells, decreased antibody response, higher incidence for cancer ❖ Microbiota: collection or community of microbes, essential for immune function o Ongoing research to better understand o Disruption and lack of diversity are possibly causing diseases: CV disease, anorexia, IBS, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis ❖ Laboratory tests o Table 18.4 (pg 271-274) ❖ Diagnostic tests o Gene testing: genome mapping data; noninvasive o Biopsy: examined through microscope; invasive o Skin testing: only with intact immune system; invasive ❖ Therapeutic interventions o Immunotherapy: desensitization of person with anaphylactic reaction or chronic allergic symptoms;

usually on trunk of body • Dx: physical exam • Therapeutic measures: chronic urticaria may require IgE monoclonal antibody therapy ▪ Angioedema: most common type of allergic reaction; form of urticaria • Patho: swelling from temporary vascular permeability withing subcutaneous and submucosal layers • S/S: local swelling, with or without hives, non-pruritic, painless o Life threatening when upper airway is involved • Dx: skin testing; H&P • Therapeutic measures: antigen or allergen desensitization o Type II hypersensitivity reactions: destruction of cell or substance that has antigen attached to cell membrane; antigen is sensed as either IgG or IgM; can be beneficial if bacteria but not beneficial when RBCs are sensed as foreign (causes blood to be destroyed) ▪ Hemolytic transfusion reactions • Patho: RBCs with foreign antigens rapidly lysed, occludes blood vessels; agglutination (clumping) occurs o Type O are universal donors o Type AB are universal recipients o Type is only 2% of population (very rare) • S/S: ischemia, necrosis; life threatening • Dx: antihuman globulin is added to see if agglutination occurs • Therapeutic measures: prevention is key; antihistamines, corticosteroids, sympathomimetics o Rhogam: For Rho (D) negative patients who accidentally receive positive blood; can be form fetus by delivery, miscarriage, abortion, amniocentesis, or intra-abdominal trauma • Nursing care: two nurses must double check all blood administration, stay at bedside for first 15 minutes, stop immediately if reaction is noted o If reaction occurs, keep vein patent with normal saline infusion, contact HCP, and stay with patient monitoring vitals and symptoms o Type III hypersensitivity reaction: immune complexes formed by antigens and antibodies within blood vessels, usually IgG type; leads to blood vessel damage (caused by neutrophils), red edematous lesion, bleeding, and necrosis ▪ Serum sickness: very rare; brief and self-limiting; antigen-antibody complexes cause symptoms of inflammation; 7-10 days after penicillin/sulfonamide • S/S: severe urticaria and angioedema • Dx: sedimentation rate, and c-reactive protein elevate due to inflammation; increased IgG and IgM • Therapeutic measures: antipyretics, analgesics, and anti- inflammatories antihistamines, arthralgia o Type IV hypersensitivity reaction: delayed reaction; sensitized T lymphocyte contacts antigen; cell-mediated immune response; necrosis ▪ Contact dermatitis: when you change soaps, detergent, or when other chemicals come in contact with skin before they’re absorbed and binded to haptens (special proteins);
