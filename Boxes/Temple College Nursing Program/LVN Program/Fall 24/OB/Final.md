### **Summary of Chapter 13: Preterm and Post-term Newborns**

**Preterm Newborns**

- **Characteristics**: Transparent skin, lack of subcutaneous fat, superficial veins, abundant lanugo, and underdeveloped physical structures.
- **Complications**:
    - Respiratory: Risk of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) due to insufficient surfactant.
    - Temperature regulation: Prone to hypothermia and cold stress.
    - Hypoglycemia: Monitoring and feeding are essential.
    - Jaundice: Immature liver function leads to bilirubin buildup.
- **Nursing Care**:
    - Maintain warmth (radiant warmers, kangaroo care).
    - Monitor vital signs, glucose levels, and feeding schedules.
    - Prevent and address complications (e.g., phototherapy for jaundice).
- **Family Involvement**: Education and emotional support.

**Post-term Newborns**

- **Complications**: Asphyxia, meconium aspiration, poor nutritional status, polycythemia, and birth-related injuries.
- **Nursing Goals**:
    - Address nutritional deficiencies.
    - Prevent and treat complications (e.g., seizures, birth defects).

### **Summary of Chapter 14: Newborn with Perinatal Injury or Congenital Malformation**

- **Hydrocephalus**: Characterized by an enlarged head, delayed development, and vomiting. Managed with surgical intervention and pre/post-op care.
- **Spina Bifida**: Managed through surgical repair and habilitation. Key focus areas include infection prevention, neurological assessment, and skin care.
- **Cleft Lip/Palate**: Requires surgical correction. Pre- and post-operative care focuses on infection prevention, proper nutrition, and emotional support.
- **Clubfoot**: Treated with early splinting, casting, and stretching exercises.
- **Down Syndrome**: Nursing care includes family counseling, involvement in care, and connecting families to resources.
- **Erythroblastosis Fetalis**: Prevented through RhoGam administration. Hyperbilirubinemia managed with phototherapy.
- **Meconium Aspiration Syndrome**: Involves respiratory distress; treatment includes oxygen supplementation and NICU care.
- **Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)**: Caused by maternal substance use. Key nursing care includes swaddling, reducing stimuli, and seizure observation.

### **Chapter 13: Preterm and Post-term Newborns**

**1.** A preterm infant has signs of respiratory distress. What intervention is the priority?

- **A)** Administer surfactant via endotracheal tube ✅
- **B)** Increase feeding frequency
- **C)** Apply phototherapy
- **D)** Administer glucose intravenously

**Rationale**: Preterm infants often lack surfactant, causing Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). Administering surfactant improves lung function and oxygenation. Other interventions address different issues.

---

**2.** The nurse notes a preterm infant’s temperature at 35.5°C (95.9°F). What action should be taken?

- **A)** Initiate phototherapy
- **B)** Use a radiant warmer ✅
- **C)** Encourage kangaroo care only
- **D)** Administer a warm glucose solution

**Rationale**: Hypothermia in preterm infants is managed with external heat sources such as a radiant warmer. Kangaroo care can help but is not enough for moderate hypothermia.

---

**3.** What is a characteristic of a preterm infant?

- **A)** Creases over the entire sole of the feet
- **B)** Transparent skin with visible veins ✅
- **C)** Excessive subcutaneous fat
- **D)** Well-developed muscle tone

**Rationale**: Preterm infants have underdeveloped skin and lack subcutaneous fat. Full-term infants have creases over the soles and better muscle tone.

---

**4.** A preterm infant has hypoglycemia. Which symptom should the nurse expect?

- **A)** Lethargy ✅
- **B)** Cyanosis
- **C)** Hyperactivity
- **D)** Jaundice

**Rationale**: Hypoglycemia in preterm infants often presents with lethargy, poor feeding, and weak cry. Cyanosis may indicate respiratory distress, not hypoglycemia.

---

**5.** A preterm infant is diagnosed with jaundice. What intervention should be prioritized?

- **A)** Administer phototherapy ✅
- **B)** Increase skin-to-skin contact
- **C)** Provide vitamin supplements
- **D)** Initiate gavage feeding

**Rationale**: Jaundice in preterm infants is often due to an immature liver. Phototherapy helps reduce bilirubin levels.

**6.** A preterm infant has an immature sucking reflex. Which feeding method is most appropriate?

- **A)** Breastfeeding on demand
- **B)** Gavage feeding ✅
- **C)** Spoon feeding
- **D)** Formula feeding with a standard bottle

**Rationale**: Gavage feeding is often used for preterm infants who cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing.

---

**7.** Which complication is a post-term newborn most at risk for?

- **A)** Polycythemia ✅
- **B)** Hypothermia
- **C)** Hyperbilirubinemia
- **D)** Apnea

**Rationale**: Post-term infants often develop polycythemia due to chronic intrauterine hypoxia.

---

**8.** What nursing intervention is appropriate for preventing cold stress in a preterm infant?

- **A)** Bathe the infant immediately after birth
- **B)** Perform frequent diaper changes
- **C)** Use an incubator or radiant warmer ✅
- **D)** Delay skin-to-skin contact until 6 hours post-birth

**Rationale**: Incubators or radiant warmers maintain a stable thermal environment, critical for preterm infants.

---

**9.** A nurse is monitoring a preterm infant for hypoglycemia. Which glucose level is most concerning?

- **A)** 60 mg/dL
- **B)** 50 mg/dL
- **C)** 40 mg/dL ✅
- **D)** 80 mg/dL

**Rationale**: Blood glucose levels below 40 mg/dL in neonates indicate hypoglycemia, requiring prompt treatment.

---

**10.** Which action is appropriate to manage jaundice in a preterm newborn?

- **A)** Keep the infant fully clothed under phototherapy lights
- **B)** Provide frequent feedings ✅
- **C)** Delay skin exposure to light therapy
- **D)** Administer IV antibiotics

**Rationale**: Frequent feeding promotes excretion of bilirubin via stools and urine.

**11.** What nursing intervention minimizes the risk of apnea in a preterm infant?

- **A)** Frequent feeding
- **B)** Clustering care to allow rest ✅
- **C)** Elevating the infant’s legs
- **D)** Delaying oxygen therapy

**Rationale**: Clustering care reduces stimulation and promotes rest, minimizing the risk of apnea episodes.

---

**12.** A preterm infant on phototherapy shows signs of dehydration. What should the nurse do?

- **A)** Stop phototherapy immediately
- **B)** Increase the infant’s fluid intake ✅
- **C)** Switch to a different light source

**Rationale**: Teaching parents about feeding, monitoring, and care fosters confidence and ensures better outcomes.

---

**22.** What complication is common in post-term newborns due to chronic intrauterine hypoxia?

- **A)** Polycythemia ✅
- **B)** Hyperbilirubinemia
- **C)** Hypoglycemia
- **D)** Apnea

**Rationale**: Chronic intrauterine hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis, leading to polycythemia in post-term infants.

- **A)** Place the infant in a prone position
- **B)** Apply restraints to the arms ✅
- **C)** Use a pacifier to soothe the infant
- **D)** Remove the protective dressing after 2 hours

**Rationale**: Restraints prevent the infant from touching or injuring the surgical site, supporting healing.

---

- **A)** Feed the infant immediately
- **B)** Assess head circumference ✅
- **C)** Elevate the legs
- **D)** Lay the infant flat on their back

**Rationale**: A bulging fontanelle is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. Measuring head circumference helps monitor the condition.

---

**8.** Which intervention is critical in the care of a newborn with spina bifida before surgery?

- **A)** Keep the infant in a prone position
- **B)** Feed the infant upright ✅
- **C)** Administer only formula feeds
- **D)** Use a pacifier after feeding

**Rationale**: Feeding upright minimizes the risk of aspiration and supports digestion.

**Rationale**: Increased ICP, such as bulging fontanelles or changes in vital signs, requires immediate intervention.

---

**16.** Which of the following is a key sign of neonatal abstinence syndrome?

- **A)** Excessive sleep
- **B)** High-pitched crying ✅
- **C)** Lethargy
- **D)** Normal feeding

**Rationale**: High-pitched crying is a hallmark symptom of neonatal withdrawal.

**19.** When feeding an infant with a cleft lip, what tool is most effective?

- **A)** A specialized bottle with a longer nipple ✅
- **B)** A standard baby bottle
- **C)** A feeding spoon
