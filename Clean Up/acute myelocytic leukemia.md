Acute Myelocytic [[Leukemia]] (AML), also known as Acute Myeloid [[Leukemia]], is a fast-growing form of cancer of the [[Blood]] and bone marrow. It primarily affects the myeloid line of [[Blood]] cells, which includes cells that would normally develop into red [[Blood]] cells, white [[Blood]] cells, and platelets. In AML, the bone marrow produces abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white [[Blood]] cell), red [[Blood]] cells, or platelets, leading to a variety of symptoms and complications.

### Causes and Risk Factors:
- **Genetic Mutations**: The development of AML is often linked to acquired genetic mutations in the DNA of developing myeloid cells.
- **Previous Cancer Treatment**: Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for other cancers can increase the risk of developing AML, a condition known as therapy-related AML.
- **Exposure to Chemicals**: Long-term exposure to chemicals like benzene is a known risk factor.
- **Smoking**: Tobacco smoke contains benzene and other carcinogens that may increase the risk.
- **[[Blood]] Disorders**: Certain pre-existing [[Blood]] disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders, can evolve into AML.
- **Family History**: Although rare, a family history of AML or other [[Blood]] cancers can increase risk.

### Symptoms:
Symptoms of AML develop quickly and can include:
- **Fatigue and Weakness**: Due to anemia from the rapid decrease in red [[Blood]] cells.
- **Frequent Infections**: Resulting from a shortage of normal white [[Blood]] cells.
- **Easy Bruising or Bleeding**: Caused by a low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]), leading to nosebleeds, gum bleeding, and prolonged bleeding from cuts.
- **Bone or Joint Pain**: As the bone marrow fills with abnormal cells.
- **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Particularly in the neck, armpits, or groin.
- **[[Fever]]**: Often due to infections but can also occur without infection.
- **Pale Skin**: Resulting from anemia.
- **Shortness of Breath**: Also due to anemia.

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Blood]] Tests**: A complete [[Blood]] count (CBC) often reveals a high number of abnormal white [[Blood]] cells and a low number of red [[Blood]] cells and platelets.
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: A key diagnostic test where a sample of bone marrow is examined for the presence of [[Leukemia]] cells.
- **Cytogenetic Analysis**: Testing the [[Leukemia]] cells for specific genetic mutations, which can help in classifying the subtype of AML and guiding treatment.
- **[[flow]] Cytometry**: Used to identify the types of [[Leukemia]] cells and their characteristics.

### Subtypes:
AML is a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes, classified based on the specific type of myeloid cells involved and the genetic abnormalities present. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies AML into different subtypes, such as:
- **AML with Recurrent Genetic Abnormalities**
- **AML with Myelodysplasia-related Changes**
- **Therapy-related AML**
- **AML Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)**

### Treatment:
Treatment for AML is aggressive and typically begins as soon as possible after diagnosis due to the rapid progression of the disease:
- **[[induction]] Chemotherapy**: The first phase of treatment aims to destroy as many [[Leukemia]] cells as possible and induce remission. The most common regimen includes [[cytarabine (ara-C)]] combined with an anthracycline (e.g., [[daunorubicin]] or [[idarubicin]]).
- **Consolidation Therapy**: Following remission, additional chemotherapy (or a stem cell transplant) is used to eliminate any remaining [[Leukemia]] cells and reduce the risk of relapse.
- **Stem Cell Transplantation**: In cases where there is a high risk of relapse or if the disease has not responded to chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant may be considered to replace the diseased bone marrow with healthy donor cells.
- **Targeted Therapy**: [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., [[midostaurin]]) or [[IDH Inhibitors]] inhibitors (e.g., [[ivosidenib]], [[enasidenib]]) target specific genetic mutations in [[Leukemia]] cells.
- **Clinical Trials**: Patients may have the option to participate in clinical trials testing new treatments or drug combinations.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for AML depends on several factors, including the patientâ€™s age, overall health, specific genetic mutations, and response to treatment. Younger patients with favorable genetic markers tend to have better outcomes. The 5-year survival rate for AML varies widely but is generally around 25% to 30% for adults. However, with advances in treatment, survival rates are improving, particularly for patients who achieve complete remission and undergo stem cell transplantation.

AML requires prompt and intensive treatment, and ongoing research is aimed at developing more effective therapies with fewer side effects. Regular follow-up care is essential for managing potential complications and detecting any signs of relapse.
