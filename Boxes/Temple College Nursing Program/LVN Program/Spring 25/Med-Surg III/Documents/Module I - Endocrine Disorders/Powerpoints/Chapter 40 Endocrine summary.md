**Diabetes Mellitus Summary**

### Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high [[Blood]] glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.

### Type 1 Diabetes
* Caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells
* Results in absolute insulin deficiency
* Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss

### Type 2 Diabetes
* Caused by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion
* Risk factors include obesity, [[Heredity]], metabolic syndrome, and age
* Symptoms are often mild or absent at diagnosis

### Diagnostic Criteria
* Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL
* Oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL
* Random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL in presence of symptoms

### Management
* Lifestyle modifications: diet, exercise, weight loss, and stress management
* Medications: oral hypoglycemics, insulin therapy, and [[glucagon]]-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists
* Monitoring: [[Blood]] glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and kidney function tests

### Complications
* Microvascular complications:
	+ Diabetic retinopathy
	+ Diabetic nephropathy
	+ Diabetic neuropathy
* Macrovascular complications:
	+ Coronary artery disease
	+ Peripheral arterial disease
	+ Stroke

### Acute Complications
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)
