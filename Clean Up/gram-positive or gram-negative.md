In microbiology, the terms "gram-positive" and "gram-negative" refer to the way bacteria react to a staining procedure called Gram staining.

**Gram Staining:**
The Gram stain is a type of differential stain that helps identify bacterial species based on their cell wall composition. The stain consists of two main components:

1. Crystal violet (a purple dye)
2. Iodine (a mordant)

Here's how the stain works:

* Bacteria are first stained with crystal violet, which binds to the peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall.
* Then, the bacteria are treated with iodine, which helps fix the stain and makes it more visible.
* Finally, the bacteria are washed with ethanol or acetone, which removes the purple dye from gram-negative bacteria.

**Gram-Positive Bacteria:**
Bacteria that retain the purple stain after washing with ethanol or acetone are called gram-positive. This is because their cell walls contain a thick layer of peptidoglycan (also known as murein) that retains the crystal violet stain. Examples of gram-positive bacteria include:

* Staphylococcus aureus
* Streptococcus pneumoniae
* Bacillus subtilis

**Gram-Negative Bacteria:**
Bacteria that lose the purple stain after washing with ethanol or acetone are called gram-negative. This is because their cell walls lack a thick layer of peptidoglycan and have an outer membrane that prevents the crystal violet stain from binding. Examples of gram-negative bacteria include:

* Escherichia coli (E. coli)
* Pseudomonas aeruginosa
* [[Haemophilus influenzae]]

The Gram stain is an important tool in microbiology, as it helps identify bacterial species and [[Guide]] treatment decisions. However, it's essential to note that the Gram stain is not a definitive method for identifying bacteria, and other tests may be necessary to confirm the [[identity]] of a particular bacterium.
