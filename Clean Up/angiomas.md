Angiomas are ==benign (non-cancerous) growths made up of abnormal blood vessels==. They can appear as red, purple, or bluish spots on the skin or inside the body. 

Types of Angiomas: 

- **Cherry angiomas:** Small, bright red dots that typically appear on the trunk, arms, and legs. 
- **Spider angiomas:** Fine, web-like blood vessels that radiate from a central point. 
- **Venous malformations:** Larger, bluish masses of blood vessels that may bulge or pulsate. 
- **Angiokeratomas:** Small, raised bumps that are often dark red or purple in color. 

Causes: 

The exact cause of most angiomas is unknown. However, some factors that may increase the risk of developing angiomas include: 

- Hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy)

- Sun exposure

- Genetics

- Certain medications 

Symptoms:

Most angiomas are asymptomatic (do not cause any symptoms). However, some may: 

Bleed easily, Itch or burn, and Cause pain or discomfort. 

Treatment:

Most angiomas do not require treatment. However, if an angioma is causing symptoms or cosmetic concerns, treatment options include: 

Laser therapy, Sclerotherapy (injection of a solution to block the blood flow), and Surgical removal. 

Prognosis: 

Angiomas are typically benign and do not spread to other parts of the body. Most angiomas remain stable or regress over time.
