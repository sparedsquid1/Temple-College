{"path":"Pasted image 20250411062753.png","text":"Congenital heart defects that cause blood to shunt from the higher pressure left side of the heart to the lower pressure right side (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) increase pulmonary blood flow. Left-to-right shunting results in pulmonary congestion, causing increased work of breathing and decreased lung compliance. Compensatory mechanisms (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis) result from sympathetic stimulation. Clinical manifestations of acyanotic defects may include: « Tachypnea « Tachycardia, even at rest « Diaphoresis during feeding or exertion (Option 3) « Heart murmur or extra heart sounds (Option 4) « Signs of congestive heart failure » Increased metabolic rate with poor weight gain (Option 5)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
