Circle your answer on the chart. 32 • Powdered medications that are not stable in liquid form for prolong periods of time • Rules: • Must determine both the type and amount of diluent to be used (on med label) • Must determine the volume in mL of diluent to be used for the route ordered (on med label) • Once medication is reconstituted – note the resulting supply dosage on the vial or what it “yields” 12/3/2024 17 33 34 12/3/2024 18 35 • Steps • The type and amount of diluent • The resulting volume after powder has been reconstituted • Example: added 2 mL of diluent to vial – resulting volume 2.2 mL • So let’s say the dosage of medication ends up being 125 mg/2.2 mL. The order is for 100 mg every 8 hours. How would you set this up?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
