The frequency is determined by the start of one single contraction to the start of another single contraction. Define an interval of a contraction ? An interval of a contraction is referred to as the resting period between contractions. \t\t\t\t\tSEE IMAGE SAFETY ALERTâ€¦. ðŸ¡ª Notify RN if contractions are more frequent (the start of one contraction to the start of another) than two minutes apart. If contractions last longer than 90 seconds or have intervals (resting periods) greater than 60 seconds. Stop OXYTOCIN IF IT IS RUNNING. What is Fetal lie and what relation is it to the mom ? Fetal lie is how the fetus is presenting in the mother stomach in accordance to the long axis of the mom -Longitudinal lieðŸ¡ª baby is head down (head toward the pelvic area) -Longitudinal lie (Breech presentation)ðŸ¡ª fetus is still aligned with spine but is not head down. The fetus us breech head up towards the chest and is butt down towards the pelvis. -Transverse lieðŸ¡ª the fetus positioned across the abdominal area horizontally. Head to the right or left side of one abdominal and feet toward the other side What is fetal attitude defined as? What are three positions of the fetal attitude and how is it related to the birthing process? Fetal attitude is the babies flexation. The three positions of flexion are the following Flexion Deflexion Extension ðŸ¡ªThe flexiation of the baby relates to the birth in a manner of how the well the baby is delivered. Its in relation to how the babies joints are flexed or extended. Flexion is the preferred and easiest for delivery. What is the fetal rose compass and how is it used in The fetal rose compass is used when determining what position the fetus is in, in accordance to the mom such as posterior or anterior and right or left. It is also helpful when trying to flip or maneuver a fetus to get it in the desired position. See attached image ðŸ¡ª How is labor determined? Labor and progression of labor is determined by the cervical change A patient is presenting with intermittent that she states comes and goes? What is she presenting with? Braxton hicks What is the contraction rule ? 5-1-1 5ðŸ¡ª contractions that are continuous and they are contracting every 5 minutes 1ðŸ¡ª each contraction lasts approximately one minute 1ðŸ¡ª one hourðŸ¡ª contractions are every 5 minutes and lasting one minute continuously for an hour period of time. What is the memory tool for variables, earlies, accelerations, and lates and what they co-inside with? VðŸ¡ª Variable\t\t\t\t\tC Chord compress EðŸ¡ª Early\t\t\t\t\tH Head compress AðŸ¡ª Acceleration\t\t\t\tO Okay LðŸ¡ª Late\t\t\t\t\tP Placenta insufficiency What are the four stages of labor ? First stageðŸ¡ª begins with regular contractions and ends with completion of dilation. LatentðŸ¡ª0-3, Active ðŸ¡ª 4 cm to 7 cm, transition ðŸ¡ª 7 to 10 m Stage 2 ðŸ¡ª begins with complete dilation of the cervix and ends when they fetus us delivered and is known as the expulsion stage. Stage 3ðŸ¡ª Begin right after delivery of the fetus and ends when the placenta is delivered and is know as the placenta stage, Stage 4 ðŸ¡ª Begins after the placenta is delivered and continues from 1 to 4 hours after delivery and is known as the maternal homeostatic stabilization stage. *If a mom arrives to L&D and states that she has been having cervical contractions ever 5 minutes for 2 hours the RN performs a cervical check and determines the baby is engaged, what stage is she at ? -1 1 0 -2 Baby is considered engaged at 0 station and at that point the baby should not go back and should only move down. (C The LVN is watching a fetal monitor and while observing it notices that the fetusâ€™s heart rate Falls below 110 before the contraction, what is this considered? Late Acceleration Variable Early (D early) a decel is before a contraction is known as a Early and in V.E.A.L. C.H.O.P. is aligned with head compression and the mom should be repositioned. A women presents to L&D and states that she is having on going contractions and she thinks she is leaking fluid, upon checking the cervix and doesnâ€™t feel a head but thinks she might feel a foot or a buttox, what position is the baby in ? Vertex Breech Transverse This would indicate that the baby is in B. Breech position and if the mom is in active labor could be indication for a c section. When a Foot is presenting out of the cervix what is this called ? Fank Footling Complete When is foot is presentation once out of the cervix is called foot ling B. What is considered complete in labor? Being considered complete is when the cervix is thinned 100% effaced and mom is dilated to a 10. \t\t \tWhen watching a fetal contraction strip the nurse notices that the baseline for the fetus heart rate is 120-130 and is now in the 150s for a short period of time what is this considered ? Decel Variable Early Acceleration This is considered D, a Acceleration and means that the baby is happy and is okay and is a beautiful thing to see. What is the 4th stage of labor and how long does it continue for? Expulsion 3-4 hours The completion of cervical dilation which continues until 10cm. The delivery of the fetus After the delivery of the placenta from 1 to 4 hours Its D. the fourth stage of labor is homeostasis for mom after the fetus is delivered. Which drug is used to help the placenta contract and also used to help control bleeding after birth ? \tOxytocin or PITocin is used to help the uterus contract and put women in to labor but it is also used to help control bleeding and in prevention of a postpartum hemorrhage Upon ultrasound the nurser noticed that the baby horizontal not vertical what is this called? \tIts known as a transverse lie. When the baby is horizontal and not vertical.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
