### Mechanisms of Action
#### Oxymetazoline MOA and Nursing Considerations

### Mechanism of Action (MOA):

- **Alpha-[[Adrenergic]] Agonist**: Oxymetazoline primarily acts as a selective **α1-[[Adrenergic]]** receptor agonist, with partial effects on **α2-[[Adrenergic]]** receptors.
- **Vasoconstriction**: By stimulating these receptors, it induces vasoconstriction (narrowing of [[Blood]] vessels) in the nasal [[Mucosa]] and ocular tissues.
- **Nasal Decongestion**: In nasal sprays, this vasoconstriction reduces [[Blood]] [[flow]] to swollen nasal passages, leading to decreased nasal congestion.
- **Reduction of Redness**: In eye drops, oxymetazoline causes vasoconstriction of conjunctival [[Blood]] vessels, reducing eye redness.

### Nursing Considerations:

- **Rebound Congestion**:
    - Prolonged use (more than 3-5 days) can lead to **[[rhinitis]] medicamentosa** (rebound congestion). Advise patients to avoid extended use and to follow recommended dosing intervals.
- **Cautious Use in Certain Populations**:
    - Use cautiously in patients with **hypertension**, **cardiovascular disease**, or **glaucoma**, as vasoconstriction may exacerbate these conditions.
- **Monitor for Side Effects**:
    - Common side effects include **burning**, **stinging**, or **dryness** of the nasal passages, and occasional **headache** or **nausea**.
- **Proper Administration**:
    - Ensure the patient uses the correct technique when administering nasal sprays to avoid direct contact with the nasal [[Mucosa]] and minimize systemic absorption.
- **Avoid Overuse**:
    - Emphasize the importance of not exceeding the recommended dosage to avoid complications like systemic absorption and rebound effects.
