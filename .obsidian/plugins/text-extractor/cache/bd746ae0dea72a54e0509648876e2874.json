A client receiving mepenzolate is reporting a cottonmouth feeling. Which action by the nurse is most appropriate? A) Inspect the throat for signs of an infection. B) Suggest the client avoid ingesting water before taking the drug. C) Check the oral cavity daily for soreness or ulcerations. D) Suggest the client avoid the use of ice or cold beverages. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should check the oral cavity daily for soreness or ulcerations when caring for a client with severe mouth dryness. The nurse should encourage the client to take a few sips of water before and while taking the drug and to sip water at intervals during meals. If allowed, hard candy slowly dissolved in the mouth and frequent sips of water during the day may help relieve persistent oral dryness. There is no need to inspect the throat for infection or to avoid ice and cold beverages.

A client is experiencing photophobia secondary to the administration of a cholinergic blocking drug. Which action would be most appropriate? A) Keeping the client's room brightly lit B) Limiting the use of overhead lights C) Encouraging the client to use sunscreen D) Suggesting the client avoid watching television Answer: B Rationale: If photophobia is a problem, the client may need to wear shaded glasses when going outside, even on cloudy days. Rooms are kept dimly lit and curtains or blinds closed to eliminate bright sunlight in the room. Those with photophobia may be more comfortable in a semi-darkened room, especially on sunny days. It is a good idea to use overhead lights as little as possible. Sunscreen would be appropriate for photosensitivity, not photophobia. Avoiding television would be appropriate if the client experienced mydriasis and cycloplegia.

The nurse is preparing a client scheduled for abdominal surgery to begin at 0730. The client is to receive a preoperative medication of meperidine and scopolamine. The client also has an antibiotic to be administered prior to surgery. The nurse's first action should be to: A) raise the side rails. B) administer the preoperative medication intramuscular (IM) as ordered. C) administer the antibiotic over 30 minutes intravenous as ordered. D) give report to the perioperative nurse. Answer: B Rationale: Based upon the choices available, the nurse should provide the preoperative medication of meperidine and scopolamine IM first so that the medication will take effect drying mucous membranes, relaxing the client, and preparing the client for general anesthesia. The nurse should next practice safety measures of explaining the importance of staying in bed, and raising the side rails and placing the call light in reach. Next, the nurse should hang the antibiotic, and then give hand off report to the perioperative nurse.

A nurse would monitor a client receiving a cholinergic blocking drug for an increased effect when the drug is administered with which additional drug(s)? Select all that apply. A) Fluconazole B) Meperidine C) Haloperidol D) Amitriptyline E) Digoxin Answer: B, D Rationale: A nurse may notice an increased effect of the cholinergic blocking drug when it is administered with meperidine and amitriptyline because meperidine and tricyclic antidepressants increase the effect of the cholinergic blockers. If given with fluconazole, an antifungal agent, the effectiveness of the antifungal agent decreases. If given with haloperidol, haloperidol's effectiveness is decreased. If given with digoxin, the risk for digoxin toxicity increases. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 26 Learning Objective: 1 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 317, Interactions 17. The nurse should monitor clients taking which medication(s) closely for decreased efficacy if a cholinergic blocking drug is initiated? Select all that apply. A) Fluconazole B) Meperidine C) Haloperidol D) Amitriptyline E) Digoxin Answer: A, C Rationale: The nurse should monitor clients taking fluconazole and haloperidol closely for decreased efficacy if a cholinergic blocking drug is initiated. Meperidine and amitriptyline will increase the cholinergic blocker effect, and the use of digoxin with a cholinergic blocking drug will increase the serum level of digoxin and could result in digoxin toxicity.
