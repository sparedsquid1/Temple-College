{"path":"Boxes/ChelseaFiles/PHARM MOD 7 - Copy - ML 1-Copy(1).pdf","text":"PHARM MOD 7 CHAPTER 48 YELLOW PAGES ‚û¢ Nursing process: - Pre-Administration Assessment: . Assess patient for signs of Anemia (Bleeding, or infection) . The patient may NOT feel comfortable or readily report fatigue, oozing from the gums or an ongoing cough. . When the patient is undergoing treatment such as for cancer, the blood counts will be used to titrate the drug dose. . Monitor the patient‚Äôs appearance during & after administration (Fatigue, SOB, sore tongue, headache, & Pallor) . ALWAYS obtain patients Vitals before any drug is administered. (Could determine whether the drug is given or not) - Ongoing Assessment: . If the vital signs such as heart or respiration rate increase, this can indicate low RBCs; these should be frequently monitored. . Monitor for patients' symptoms of relief during and after administration. (Some patients may feel relief after a few days) . When the patient is receiving oral iron supplements, inform the patient that the color of their stool will appear darker or black. (IF diarrhea or constipation occurs contact HCP) Nursing Diagnosis: . Fatigue related to Dilutional anemia, caused by fluid retention. . Imbalanced nutrition: (less than the body requirements) related to lack of iron folic acid. . Constipation is related to adverse reactions in iron therapy. Med Tip: - If parenteral iron dextran is administered, inform the patient that soreness at the injection site may occur. - Teach the patient to check injection sites daily for signs of inflammation, swelling, or abscess formation. ‚û¢ Implementation: Med Tip: Epoetin Alfa - When Epoetin Alfa is administered to a patient with hypertension, monitor the blood pressure closely. - Report Any rise of 20mmHg or more in the systolic or diastolic pressure to the HCP - The hematocrit lab draw is usually measured before each dose during therapy with Epoetin Alfa. - This drug is given 3X weekly IV or subQ - If the patient is receiving Dialysis, the drug is administered into the venous access line. - This drug is mixed gently during preparation, do not shake too hard or it could denature the Glycoprotein. NURSING ALRRT ‚ùóÔ∏è -The target hemoglobin is no more than 11 g /dL Myocardial infarction and stroke are more likely to occur when the hemoglobin rises higher. Additionally, report any increase in the hematocrit of 4 points within any 2- week period, because an exacerbation of hypertension is associated with an excessive rise of hematocrit. Withholding the drug lowers blood levels. Med Tip: Iron - Iron supplements are preferably given between meals with water. - People who cannot tolerate taking it with water may need to take it with food. - Milk and antacids may interfere with absorption of iron and should not be taken at the same time as an iron supplement. - Iron Dextran is given by the IM or IV route. - Before Iron Dextran is administered a test dose of 0.5ml may be administered IV at gradual rate over a period of 30 seconds or more. - A test dose is also given before administering the first dose of iron dextran IM by injecting 0.5ml into the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks. - Monitor the patient for an allergic response for at least one hour after the test dose and before administering the remaining of the dose. - Epinephrine is kept on standby in the event of a severe anaphylactic reaction. - After the test dose the prescribed dose of iron is administered IM. The drug is given into the muscle mass of the buttocks, upper outer quadrant, never into an arm or other area, using the Z track method. - A LARGE BORE needle is required (if patient is standing have the patient place wait on the leg, not receiving the injection) NURSING ALERT ‚ùóÔ∏è - Parenteral administration of iron has resulted in fatal anaphylactic -type reaction. Instruct patient to report immediately any of the following adverse reactions: . Dyspnea . Urticaria . Rashes . Itching, and fever Med Tip: Vitamin B12 - Patients with vitamin B 12 anemia are treated with vitamin B12 IM administered weekly. - The parenteral route is used because the vitamin is in effective orally. (owing to the absence of the intrinsic factor of the stomach) - Injections may be necessary for life. - Vitamin B 12 is available in an intranasal form for those who are on maintenance therapy. ‚û¢ Monitoring & Managing Patient's Needs: . During administration of the CSF drugs the patient may experience fluid retention. . With the increase in fluid volume, this makes the ratio of cells to fluid in the blood less which can result in delutional anemia. (Patient may experience fatigue due to this anemia) . Educate the patient in the family about energy saving skills to help maintain the same level of activities of daily living. - Imbalanced nutrition: (less than the body requirements) . A balanced diet is recommended with an emphasis on foods that are high in iron. (lean red meats, cereals, dried beans, and leafy green vegetables) . Foods that contain folic acid, such as green, leafy vegetables, liver and yeast. . Foods containing vitamin B 12 such as beef, pork, eggs, milk, and milk products. . Small portions of food may be more appealing than large or moderate portions. If the patient is unable to eat well, note this on the patient‚Äôs chart, and bring the problem to the attention of a PCP. ‚û¢ Constipation: . Constipation may become a problem when a patient is taking oral iron medication. . Educate patients to increase fluid intake to 10-12 glasses of water daily and to eat a high fiber diet and to increase activity. üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è EDUCATION FOR PATIENTS & FAMILY: ‚û¢ Hematopoietic Factors: . The drug is administered 3X per week (IV route, SubQ, or dialysis access line) . Blood tests are performed to determine the effects of the drug and to determine the dosage. . STRICT compliance with the anti-hypertensives drug regimen is important in patients with known hypertension during Epoetin Alfa therapy. Med Tip: - Patients might have heard about problems with the drug Leukine . The product was withdrawn temporarily because of reports of adverse reactions including syncope (fainting). - This was correlated with a change in the formulation of the drug, which included edetate disodium (EDTA)That formula has been taken off the market and Leukine is now considered safe. - When done with injections throw needles into shape container at home and return to the proper agency for disposal. ‚û¢ Iron: . Take Iron on an empty stomach with water. . Do not take Antacids tetracyclines, penicillamine, or fluoroquinolones at the same time or 2 hours before or after taking iron without first checking with the PCP. . Iron could cause darkening of the stool constipation or diarrhea. . Mix the LIQUID IRON prep with water or juice and then drink through a straw to help prevent staining of the teeth! ‚û¢ Folic Acid: . Avoid the use of multivitamin preparations unless they have been approved by the primary health care provider. . Follow the diet recommended by the primary health care provider, because diet and drug are necessary to correct anemia associated with folic acid deficiency. ‚û¢ Leucovorin: . Megaloblastic anemia adheres to the diet prescribed by the primary health care provider. If the purchase of foods high in protein (which can be expensive) becomes a problem, discuss this with the primary health care provider. ‚û¢ Vitamin B12: . Eat a balanced diet that includes Seafood, Eggs, Meats, & Dairy products . Pernicious anemia- lifetime therapy is necessary. Eat a balanced diet that includes seafood, eggs, meats, and dairy products. Avoid contact with infections and report any signs of infection immediately because an increase of the dosage may be necessary. üîë KEY POINTS üîë Immunomodulating agents are used to stimulate or suppress the immune system to treat a variety of diseases. Chronic diseases such as kidney failure or treatments such as chemotherapy can reduce the number of cells in the circulation, causing fatigue, bleeding, or infection. CSFs are one type of immunostimulant that can boost the number of cells. The hematopoietic system is composed of fluid and three types of cells. RBCs supply the body with oxygen, WBCs protect the body from microorganisms, and platelets control bleeding. These drugs are fragile and must be mixed before administration. They are given subcut or intravenously. Adverse reactions include flu-like symptoms. A dramatic reduction in cells of the specific type stimulated will occur when the injections are stopped. Anemia is a condition caused by reduced amounts of hemoglobin causing less oxygen to be delivered to the tissues. Anemia occurs because of chronic illnesses or specific deficiencies such as iron. Immunosuppressants are used for chronic diseases with an autoimmune component and to aid in organ transplant by reducing the threat of organ rejection. - ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ON TO MORE SHIT WE NEED TO KNOW AS IF WE HAVE A CHOICE‚Ä¶. üìñ INFORMATION FROM CHAPTER üìñ ‚û¢ The Hematopoietic System: . This system is composed of fluids & particles known as BLOOD. - Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes) that supply our cells with oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. - White blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes) that protect our bodies from dangerous microorganisms. - Platelets (megakaryocytes) that control the bleeding from microscopic to major tears in our tissues. - Hematologic Failure: . Chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or medical treatments, such as chemotherapy can cause hematologic failure. . When this happens, inadequate numbers of cells are produced and as a result, the body can no longer meet the demands of oxygen transportation, blood coagulation, or prevention of invasion of microorganisms. . The goal for treating these hematologic problems is to stimulate the body to make more of the specific blood cells. (This process is called Hematopoiesis) . During this process undifferentiated stem cells in the bone marrow are signaled to multiply and differentiate into erythrocytes, leukocytes, or megakaryocytes . Hematopoietic drugs help to enhance this process and are used to treat anemia, bleeding, and infection. ‚û¢ Immunostimulant drugs used to treat infection or potential bleeding: - There are a number of different WBCs that protect the body from microbial invasion and infection. The WBC known as the neutrophil is one of the major cells in the line of defense from infection. - Neutropenia is the term for the condition that results when the neutrophil level in the blood is low. - Infection is likely to occur when a patient is neutropenic. Neutrophils have an extremely short lifespan (6 to 8 hours), meaning that they rapidly grow and divide. Because of their rapid growth cycle, the neutrophil is a prime target for destruction by the cancer chemotherapy drugs, as well as the cancer cells them- selves. - Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a major reason that cancer treatments may be delayed or cancelled. When this happens, the patient is at a greater risk for continued growth of the cancer or illness from the treatment. - CSFs are drugs used to stimulate the growth and production of WBCs to help fight off infection. ‚û¢ Colony-Stimulating Factors: - Actions & Uses: . CSFS are glycoproteins (cellular protein with attached that act on the hematopoietic cells to stimulate proliferation sugar) differentiation, and maturation of WBCs. . CSFs are used to treat or prevent infection (by minimizing neutropenia) associated with the following: ‚ñ™Ô∏èChemotherapy -induced neutropenia during solid tumor cancer treatment ‚ñ™Ô∏èNeutropenia during bone marrow transplantation (BMT) ‚ñ™Ô∏è Production of stem cells for harvest before bone marrow transplant ‚ñ™Ô∏èNeutropenia in those susceptible to symptomatic chronic infection . Injections of the CSF filgrastim are started at least 24 hours after the completion of a cycle of chemotherapy. . The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is monitored, and therapy is continued until an ANC count of at least 10000/mm^3 is achieved. . It is NOT recommended to use the drug for longer than 2 weeks. . Treatment is discontinued at least a day before the next chemo-therapy cycle is to begin. . Pegfilgrastim is similar to filgrastim but is given as a single dose between chemotherapy cycles. . Sargeamostim is used following BMT. (Following induction of chemotherapy used with leukemia and to stimulate stem cells for harvest) Adverse reactions: . Bone pain . Hypertension . N/V . Alopecia . Hypersensitivity & allergic reactions. - Contraindications, precautions, interactions: . Filgrastim is used cautiously in patients with hyperthyroid disease as well as patients breastfeeding. . PEGFILGRASTIM can cause a sickle cell crisis in those with the disease. . CSFs can cause hypersensitive reactions and should be treated with ANTIHISTAMINES, STEROIDS, & BRONCHODILATORS. . An even higher increase in Neutrophil count can occur when these drugs are taken with lithium. (Drug used for manic phase of mood disorders) ‚û¢ Drugs used to treat Thrombocytopenia: . Oprelvekin is a drug that stimulates thrombopoiesis. . Thrombopoiesis is the process of making platelets. . The drug is used to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and reduces the need for multiple platelet transfusions. . Oprelvekin is used to treat or prevent thrombocytopenia associated with chemotherapy for solid tumor cancer treatment. . Injections are started at least 6 hours after the completion of a chemotherapy cycle. . Platelet counts are Monitored, and therapy is continued until a count of at least 50,000/mcL is achieved. . It is not recommended for use for more than 21 days; treatment is discontinued at least 2 days before the next chemotherapy cycle is to begin. . Oprelvekin is used to treat ITP (an acute or chronic bleeding disorder) . Sometimes it is associated with other diseases. It is typically diagnosed by signs of bleeding (purple areas on the skin) or fatigue. (If it does not resolve on its own, then a course of corticosteroids or removal of the spleen may help) *If these treatments are unsuccessful ELTROMBOPAG & ROMIPLOSTIM are available, both drugs are only used for ITP and are NOT to be used to increase platelet count associated with Immunosuppression during chemo. *Eltrombopag can be toxic to the liver, liver function studies are done prior to starting the drug and every 2 weeks while on drug therapy. Adverse reactions: ‚ô•Ô∏è Cardiovascular system reactions: . Fluid retention . Tachycardia . Peripheral edema. . Palpitations . Dyspnea. . Atrial Fibrillation . Syncope. . Arrhythmias that lead to stroke & Pulmonary Edema . Fever/allergic reactions . Capillary leak Syndrome - HEADS UP Contraindications: . Oprelvekin should not be used in patients receiving chemotherapy that is extremely myelosuppressive. . These drugs are used cautiously in patients with renal failure heart failure, or atrial arrhythmias. Severe hypokalemia (low potassium levels) can occur if the patient is receiving the cancer chemotherapy agent ifosfamide. . Children under the age of 12 are NOT to take this drug. . Oprelvekin can cause anaphylactic-type reactions and should be permanently discontinued if these occur. . Discontinuing either eltrombopag or romiplostim may result in platelet counts lower than the original diagnosed counts. ‚û¢ Hematopoietic Drugs: Used in treating Anemia. . Anemia is a condition caused by an insufficient amount of hemoglobin delivering oxygen to the tissues. . Anemia is caused by a decrease in the number of RBC, a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in RBC, blood loss, excessive destruction of RBCs, inadequate production of RBC, and deficits in various nutrients as in IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. ‚û¢ Drugs to treat Anemia with Chronic Illness: . Cancer and chronic kidney disease are two diseases that produce disease- or treatment -related anemia. . Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAS) are glycoproteins that stimulate and regulate the production of erythrocytes. . Chronic kidney disease reduces the kidney's ability to produce erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of RBCs. Cancer treatment reduces the bone marrow's ability to produce RBCs. . Two examples of drugs used to treat anemia associated with chronic illness are epoetin alfa (Epogen) and darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp). ‚û¢ Actions & Uses: . ESAs are used to treat Anemia associated with the following: - Chronic Kidney Disease - Chemotherapy - Zidovudine (AZT) therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. - Post surgical blood replacement in place of allogeneic transfusions. . Darbepoetin Alfa (Aranesp) & Methoxy Polyethylene-Epoetin B are Erythropoiesis-stimulating profiles used to treat Anemia associated with CKD (chronic kidney disease) in patients receiving Dialysis, as well as in patients who are not receiving Dialysis. These drugs elevate or maintain RBC levels and decrease the need for transfusions. ‚û¢ Adverse Reactions: - Most common Adverse Reactions: . Hypertension . Headache . N/V/D . Rashes . Fatigue . Arthralgia . Skin reaction at injection site . Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin; EPO), darbepoetin alfa, and methoxy polyethylene are usually well tolerated when used to maintain a hemoglobin level no higher than 12 g/dL. ‚û¢ Contraindications & Precautions: - Epoetin Alfa is contraindicated in patients with: . Uncontrolled hypertension . Those needing emergency transfusions. . Those with a hypersensitivity to human albumin - Darbeopoetin Alfa (Arabesp) is contraindicated in: . Uncontrolled hypertension . In those allergic to the drug *Polycythemia (Overload of RBCs in the circulation) can occur is the hemoglobin levels are not monitored carefully and if the dose is too high. This can result in serious cardio thromboembolic events in any patient and possible tumor growth in cancer patients. ‚û¢ Drugs used to treat Iron Deficiency Anemia: . Iron is the component in hemoglobin that picks up oxygen from the lungs and Carrie‚Äôs it to the body tissues. . Approximately 50% of pregnant women and 20% of all women experience anemia . Decreased iron stores result from a decrease in RBCs; causes include heavy menstrual bleeding and poor absorption or lack of iron in the diet. ‚û¢ Actions & Uses: . Iron preparations act by elevating the serum iron concentrations, which replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores. . Oral iron supplements are typically used. Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach. . Supplemental iron is used during pregnancy and lactation, because normal dietary intake rarely supplies the required about. . Parenteral iron is used when the patient cannot take oral drugs or when the patient experiences GI intolerance to oral iron administration. ‚û¢ Adverse Reactions: - GI Reactions: . GI irritation . N/V . Constipation . Diarrhea . Darker stools (black stools) - Generalized system reactions: . Headache . Backache . Allergic reactions - Parenteral Route: . Soreness . Inflammation . Sterile Abscesses at the IM injection site . Brownish discoloration of the skin may occur - IV route: . May result in phlebitis at the injection site ‚û¢ Contraindications & Precautions: - Contraindicated in: . Patients with hemochromatosis or Hemolytic anemia . Patients with hypersensitivity to aspirin, due to these patients having a hypersensitivity to the Tartrazine or Sulfite content of some iron compounds. ‚û¢ Interactions: Interacting Drugs: Common Use: Effect on Interaction: Antibiotics Fight infection Decreased GI absorption of the antibiotic Levothyroxine Treatment of Hypothyroidism Decreased absorption of Levothyroxine Levodopa, Methyldopa Treatment of Parkinson disease Decreased effect of Anti Parkinsonism medication Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Vitamin supplement Increased absorption of iron ‚û¢ Drugs used to treat Folic Acid Deficiency Anemia: . Folic acid (folate) is required for the manufacture of RBCs in bone marrow. . Folic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, and whole grains . A deficiency of folic acid results in megaloblastic anemia (Large, abnormal, immature erythrocytes circulating in the blood) ‚û¢ Actions & Uses: . Folic Acid is used in treating Megaloblastic Anemias that are caused by deficiency of folic acid . If folic acid is taken during conception there is a decreased risk for embryonic neural tube defects during early pregnancy. (When the Embryonic folds forming the spinal cord and brain join together . Defects of this type include: . Defects of this type include anencephaly (congenital absence of brain and spinal cord), spina bifida (defect of the spinal cord), and meningocele (a sac-like protrusion of the meninges in the spinal cord or skull). . Dosage during pregnancy and lactation are as great as 0.8 mg/day. . Oral Supplements are the first choice for megaloblastic anemia and folic acid deficiency treatment. . If a patient is unable to take oral meds, Leucovorin may be used. Leucovorin: . It is more commonly used to diminish the hematologic effects of methotrexate. . Leucovorin ‚Äúrescues‚Äù normal cells from destruction caused by methotrexate and allows them to survive. . This technique of administering Leucovorin after a large dose of methotrexate is called FOLINIC ACID RESCUE. . The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folate during pregnancy is 0.4 mg/day and, during lactation, 0.26-0.28 mg/day ‚û¢ Contraindications & Precautions: . Folic acid and leucovorin are contraindicated for treating pernicious anemia or for other anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. . Pregnant women are more likely to experience folate deficiency, due to folic acid requirements increase during pregnancy. ‚û¢ Drugs used in treating Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia: . Vitamin B12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, the manufacture of myelin (which surrounds some nerve fibers), and blood cell manufacture. . The intrinsic factor, which is produced by cells in the stomach, is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the intestine. ‚û¢ Actions & Uses: - Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is used to treat patients with a vitamin B12 deficiency; this condition is seen in those who have: . A strict vegetarian (vegan) lifestyle . Total gastrectomy or subtotal gastric resection (in which the cells producing the intrinsic factor are totally or partially removed) . Intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis or sprue . Gastric Carcinoma . Congenital decrease in the number of gastric cells that secrete intrinsic factor. . Vitamin B12 is also used to perform the Schilling test which is used to diagnose pernicious anemia. . A deficiency, for any reason, will NOT occur for 5-6 years from birth. . Patients should be assessed for history of vegan diet or gastric bypass surgery. ‚ùóÔ∏èNURSING ALERT ‚ùóÔ∏è - Pernicious anemia must be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, because vitamin B12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for more than 3 months may result in degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. ‚û¢ Adverse reactions: . Mild diarrhea & itching . Increase in RBCs . Acne . Peripheral vascular thrombosis . CHF . Pulmonary Edema ‚û¢ Contraindications, precautions, interactions: . Contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Cyanocobalamin. . Administered cautiously during pregnancy. . Administered carefully in patients with pulmonary disease and anemia. . Alcohol, neomycin, and colchicine may decrease the absorption of oral vitamin B12 ‚û¢ Immunosuppressant Drugs: (Used to treat autoimmune diseases) . In immunosuppressive drug is an agent that reduces the strength of the body zone immune system. . Autoimmune disorders you are likely to see treated with immunosuppressive drugs include conditions such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis (GI system), and rheumatoid arthritis. ‚û¢ Drugs used to suppress immunity include: . Corticosteroids (Prednisone): Prevent production of Cytokines & interleukins so lymphocytes do NOT respond. . Calcineurin inhibitors (Tacrolimus or Cyclosporine) . mTOR Inhibitors (Sirolimus) . IMDH Inhibitors (Azathioprine or Mycophenolate) . Biologics (Adalimunab or etanercept): lysis of lymphocytes . Monoclonal antibodies (Basiliximab) ‚û¢ Adverse Reactions: . Headache . Chills . Fever . Dizziness . Myalgias Calcineurin inhibitors may cause: Gum Hyperplasia, Hair growth, or tremors. Monoclonal antibodies may cause a patient to feel nauseated or experience GI distress. ‚û¢ Contraindications, precautions, interactions: . Vaccines with LIVE viruses should NOT be given if the patient is on an immunosuppressant agent. . Increased risk of infection due to these drugs decreasing immunity. (Monitor for Neutropenia) . Severe reduction in red cells, white cells, and platelets is seen when those taking IMDH inhibitors are also taking ACEI for hypertension HIV+ patients should NOT take alefacept (used for plaque psoriasis) . Calcineurin inhibitors are NEPHROTOXIC in high doses (BUN should be monitored) . Cardiac arrhythmias are more likely to occur if taking Calcineurin inhibitors. . Lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide are administered under strict supervision in special programs because of the severe birth defects that occur if taken while pregnant. . Many of the immunosuppressant agents interact with grapefruit juice and other citrus. ‚ùóÔ∏èNURSING ALERT ‚ùóÔ∏è - Although infusion reactions occur in about 3% to 4% of those receiving monoclonal antibodies, they are more likely to happen when they are derived from mouse tissue. The key to knowing this is in the suffix of the drug name. Drugs ending in ‚Äì ‚ÄúMOMAB‚Äù are derived from mice and have the highest risk for hypersensitive reaction.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
