### **Summary of Chapter 16: The Infant**

#### **Developmental Theories**

- **Erikson:** Trust vs. Mistrust – Infants develop trust when caregivers are responsive and consistent.
- **Freud:** Orality – Infants find comfort in sucking.
- **Kohlberg:** Preconventional – Moral reasoning is driven by avoiding punishment.
- **Sullivan:** Security – Security and comfort are essential.
- **Piaget:** Sensorimotor (birth to 2 years) – Infants learn through sensory exploration and motor activities.

#### **Physical and Motor Development**

- **Reflexes & Milestones:**
    - Grasp reflex disappears at 3 months.
    - Prehension (grasping objects) develops by 5–6 months.
    - Pincer grasp well established by 12 months.
    - Moro reflex disappears by 3 months; Babinski reflex persists up to 12–18 months.
    - Object permanence appears around 8 months.

#### **Emotional & Social Development**

- Infants need **consistent caregiving** to establish trust.
- Infants picked up when they cry tend to have **fewer behavioral problems** later.

#### **Growth & Nutrition**

- **Weight:** Doubles by 6 months, triples by 12 months.
- **Height:** Increases 2.5 cm/month for first 6 months.
- **Head Circumference:** Increases 1.5 cm/month for first 6 months.
- **Fontanelles:** Posterior closes at 2 months, anterior by 18 months.
- **Nutrition:**
    - Breast milk or formula for the first year.
    - **No cow’s milk** before 12 months.
    - Introduce solid foods at 5–6 months (rice cereal first).

#### **Infant Development by Month**

- **1 month:** Head lag present, sleeps 20 hours/day.
- **2 months:** Posterior fontanel closes, responsive smiling.
- **4 months:** Lifts head & shoulders, teething begins.
- **6 months:** Can sit with support, introduce solid foods.
- **9 months:** Crawling, pincer grasp developing, adds meat/beans to diet.
- **12 months:** Triples birth weight, walks with assistance, speaks simple words.

#### **Common Infant Concerns**

- **Colic:** Swaddle, rock, use pacifiers, keep a calm environment.
- **Sleep Patterns:** Sleep in 4-hour intervals initially; by 6 months, can sleep up to 8 hours.
- **Illness Prevention:** Regular immunizations and growth assessments.

#### **Safety Considerations**

- **Car seats:** Rear-facing until age 2.
- **Choking hazards:** Avoid small foods/toys.
- **Drowning prevention:** Never leave unattended near water.
- **Suffocation:** Place infants on their backs to sleep.

## **NCLEX-Style Questions & Rationales**

### **1. A mother expresses concern about spoiling her newborn by holding him when he cries. What is the best response by the nurse?**
