Cystitis is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. It is most commonly caused by a bacterial infection, which is referred to as a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, cystitis can also result from non-infectious causes such as certain medications, radiation therapy, irritants like hygiene sprays, or prolonged use of a catheter.

### Common Symptoms of Cystitis:
- A strong, persistent urge to urinate
- A burning sensation during urination
- Passing frequent, small amounts of urine
- Cloudy or strong-smelling urine
- Pelvic discomfort or lower abdominal pain
- [[Blood]] in the urine (hematuria)

### Treatment:
Treatment often involves antibiotics if the cystitis is due to a bacterial infection. Non-infectious cystitis is managed by addressing the underlying cause (e.g., avoiding irritants, adjusting medication, etc.). Drinking plenty of water, avoiding irritants, and over-the-counter pain relievers may help alleviate symptoms.

If you think you might have cystitis or are experiencing symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
