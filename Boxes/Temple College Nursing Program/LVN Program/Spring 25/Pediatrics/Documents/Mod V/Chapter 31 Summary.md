## ✅ Chapter Summary: The Child with a Metabolic Condition

### 1. **Overview of the Endocrine System**
- The endocrine system works with the nervous system to regulate vital body functions, including metabolism, growth, maturation, reproduction, and stress response.
- It consists of ductless glands that release hormones directly into the bloodstream.

### 2. **Early Signs of Metabolic Disorders in Children**
- Common signs include:
    - Lethargy
    - Failure to thrive (FTT)
    - Poor feeding
    - Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
- **Diagnostics**: X-rays, blood chemistries, thyroid function tests, ultrasounds, and CT scans.

---

### 3. **Tay-Sachs Disease**
- A rare inherited disorder due to the absence of lysosomal-beta-hexosaminidase, which leads to lipid accumulation in the brain.
- **Clinical signs**:
    - Developmental delays
    - Muscle weakness (head lag)
    - Cherry-red spot on the retina
    - Blindness and mental retardation
- **Management**: No cure; palliative care and supportive measures are emphasized.

---

### 4. **Hypothyroidism**
- Caused by a deficiency in thyroid hormone production.
- **Symptoms**:
    - Hypotonia (“floppy” infant)
    - Macroglossia (enlarged tongue)
    - Dry skin
    - Cold extremities
- **Treatment**:
    - Lifelong thyroid hormone replacement
    - Close monitoring to avoid overdose or underdose:
        - Overdose: Irritability, sweating, weight loss, tachycardia
        - Underdose: Lethargy, constipation, cold intolerance

---

### 5. **Diabetes Insipidus (DI)**
- **Cause**: Deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), often from pituitary issues.
- **Symptoms**:
    - Polyuria, polydipsia
    - Dehydration, dry skin, weight loss
- **Treatment**:
    - Desmopressin (DDAVP)
    - Water restriction when needed (due to risk of water intoxication)
    - Family education, emergency medical ID, and careful fluid management

---

### 6. **Diabetes Mellitus (DM)**
- A chronic metabolic disorder due to impaired glucose transport and improper fat metabolism.
- **Types**:
    - **Type 1 DM** (Juvenile): Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Insulin-dependent.
    - **Type 2 DM**: Linked to obesity/sedentary lifestyle. Insulin resistance or decreased production.
	
#### Long-term Complications:
- Retinopathy (blindness), nephropathy, neuropathy, vascular disease (risk of amputation)

#### Diagnosis:
- **Random glucose**: screening
- **Fasting glucose**: >126 mg/dL (twice) = diagnostic
- **HbA1c**: >10% = poor control; goal is <7.5%

---

### 7. **Type 1 Diabetes in Children**
- Peak onset: ages 5–7 and 11–13
- Can be triggered by stress or illness
- May present with **diabetic ketoacidosis** at diagnosis
- More unstable in children due to growth and variable activity

---

### 8. **Insulin Administration**
- Insulin must be injected (usually subcutaneous)
- Children >7 years old may self-inject
- Rotate injection sites; avoid active areas (e.g., legs during biking)
- Mix insulin correctly: clear (regular) before cloudy (intermediate)

---

### 9. **Hypoglycemia (Insulin Shock)**
- More common in children
- **Symptoms**:
    - Hunger, pallor, irritability, sweating, fatigue
- **Causes**:
    - Excess insulin, unplanned exercise, missed meals
- **Treatment**:
    - Fast-acting sugar (juice, candy), then a protein or starch
    - **Glucagon** for severe episodes

---

### 10. **Teaching Plan for a Child with DM**
Key areas:
- Pancreatic and insulin function
- Diet and blood glucose monitoring
- Skin, foot, and emotional care
- Sick day management and travel preparedness
- Education must be family-centered and age-appropriate

## 📘 NCLEX-Style Questions (with Rationales)

---

**1.** A child diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism is prescribed levothyroxine. Which parent statement indicates understanding of the treatment?

**A.** “We will stop the medication once the symptoms resolve.”  
**B.** “We will give the medication every day at the same time.” ✅  
**C.** “This medication is only needed during growth spurts.”  
**D.** “It is okay to skip a dose if the child feels well.”

**Rationale:** Thyroid replacement must be taken consistently and lifelong. Missing doses can lead to developmental issues.

---

**2.** Which finding suggests a child with DI is experiencing water intoxication?

**A.** Weight loss  
**B.** Polyuria  
**C.** Irritability and drowsiness ✅  
**D.** High blood pressure

**Rationale:** Overmedication with desmopressin can cause fluid retention, leading to drowsiness and behavioral changes.

---

**3.** What is the priority action when a child with Type 1 DM becomes irritable and pale during gym class?

**A.** Administer glucagon  
**B.** Call 911  
**C.** Give orange juice ✅  
**D.** Check urine for ketones

**Rationale:** These are early signs of hypoglycemia. Fast-acting sugar should be given immediately.

---

**4.** A nurse is teaching parents about insulin administration. Which instruction is correct?

**A.** Inject in the same site each time.  
**B.** Rotate sites but avoid areas of active exercise. ✅  
**C.** Use cloudy insulin first when mixing.  
**D.** Oral insulin is fine if the child dislikes needles.

**Rationale:** Injecting in exercised limbs can increase absorption rate and cause hypoglycemia.

---

**5.** A child with Tay-Sachs disease is admitted. What should the nurse focus on?

**A.** Nutritional therapy  
**B.** Gene therapy  
**C.** Palliative care ✅  
**D.** High-protein diet

**Rationale:** Tay-Sachs is untreatable; care is supportive and symptom-focused.

---

**6.** Which test confirms a diagnosis of diabetes?

**A.** Random glucose > 110 mg/dL  
**B.** Fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL on two occasions ✅  
**C.** Ketones in urine  
**D.** Low insulin levels

**Rationale:** Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two occasions is diagnostic for DM.

---

**7.** What is the best snack for a child having a mild hypoglycemic episode?

**A.** Peanut butter sandwich  
**B.** Orange juice ✅  
**C.** Apple slices  
**D.** Yogurt

**Rationale:** Orange juice provides rapid-acting glucose for quick correction.

---

**8.** A nurse teaches parents that signs of excessive thyroid hormone include:

**A.** Constipation and fatigue
