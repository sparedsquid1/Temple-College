In [[Pharmacology]], the "ceiling effect" refers to the phenomenon where, after a certain dose of a drug, increasing the dosage further does not produce a proportional increase in the desired therapeutic effect. This implies that the drug has reached its maximum efficacy, and any additional dosage will not enhance its effectiveness but may increase the risk of side effects. This effect is commonly seen with medications like certain opioids, where there is a limit to how much pain relief can be achieved, regardless of higher doses.
