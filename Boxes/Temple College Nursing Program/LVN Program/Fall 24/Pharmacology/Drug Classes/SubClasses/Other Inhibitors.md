### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions are typically inflammatory related and called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They can start as generalized feelings of malaise and progress to life-threatening issues if not addressed quickly when identified (Rubin, 2015). 
**[[Integumentary System]] Reactions** 
Common adverse reactions of skin, nails, and hair include the following: 
- Skin problems (rash, dry skin, nail changes, hair depigmentation) 
- [[photosensitivity]] 

**Gastrointestinal System Reactions** 
Diarrhea progressing to colitis, [[hepatitis]], and elevated [[Liver]] enzymes are common adverse reactions. For clients receiving [[sunitinib]] for gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, there is a rare but serious risk of bowel perforation (Kim, 2014). 

**Other Reactions** 
- Thyroid inflammation 
- Pulmonary symptoms 
- Neurological changes ([[hand and foot syndrome]]) 
- Inflammatory arthritis Acute pancreatitis 
- Inflammatory endocrine issues

Not [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] adverse reactions indicate a problem. Sometimes the reaction is a signal that the drug is working to kill the tumor cell. For example, clients treated with [[erlotinib]] or [[gefitinib]] have better outcomes (cancer improves) when the client develops an acne-like rash during therapy (Petrelli, 2012). Likewise, if a client experiences increased [[Blood]] pressure when treated with [[bevacizumab]], they tend to have a better outcome, too (Cai, 2013).
