The nurse determines a teaching session about chloroquine is successful when the client correctly articulates which factor? A) Avoid foods that acidify the urine. B) Take the drug on an empty stomach. C) Increase dosage if dosage missed once. D) Discontinue drug if color of urine changes. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should educate the client to avoid foods that acidify the urine (cranberries, plums, prunes, meats, cheeses, eggs, fish, and grains), as they may interact with the antimalarial drug and increase excretion and thereby decrease the effectiveness of chloroquine while taking the drug. Taking the drug on an empty stomach is not advisable for antimalarial drugs. The nurse should instruct the client to adhere to the dosage regimen unless instructed otherwise. Yellow or brownish discoloration of the urine during chloroquine treatment is normal; there is no need to discontinue the therapy.

A client with malaria is prescribed doxycycline. The nurse should include which instructions when teaching the client about the adverse reactions? A) Avoid taking warfarin because it increases the risk of bleeding. B) Avoid exposure to the sun by wearing protective clothing. C) Take the drug with food, or immediately afterward. D) Do not drive or perform other activities requiring alertness. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to avoid exposure to the sun by wearing protective clothing (e.g., long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats) and by using sunscreen. Combining warfarin with quinine, not doxycycline, increases the risk of bleeding. Doxycycline should be taken on an empty stomach. Doxycycline does not impair alertness, so the client can drive or perform other activities requiring alertness.

The nurse is caring for a client diagnosed with amebiasis. When developing the care plan, the nurse will include which activity? A) Take vital signs every 8 hours. B) Freeze any stool samples for testing. C) Avoid foods that acidify the urine. D) Provide the client with small, frequent meals. Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should ensure that the client has small, frequent meals (five to six daily) because these may be more appealing than three large meals. The nurse should take vital signs every 4 hours, not 8. Stool samples for testing should be maintained at room temperature and not frozen. There is no need to avoid foods that acidify the urine.

A client with intestinal amebiasis is preparing for discharge. The nurse will include which instruction when teaching the client about the prescribed metronidazole? A) Take the drug on an empty stomach. B) Avoid intake of alcohol. C) Guard against effects of photosensitivity. D) Take phenobarbital for impaired sleep. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to avoid the use of alcohol, in any form, until the course of treatment is completed. The ingestion of alcohol may cause a mild to severe reaction, with symptoms of severe vomiting, headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, flushing, and sweating. Metronidazole should be taken with food or meals, not on an empty stomach. Photosensitivity is not one of the side effects of metronidazole. Phenobarbital should be avoided, as it increases the metabolism of metronidazole.
