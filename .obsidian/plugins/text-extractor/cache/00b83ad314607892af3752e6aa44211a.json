Hemorrhage Signs and symptoms of hemorrhage Decrease B/P Increase pulse rate & respirations Restlessness Diaphoresis, cold, clammy skin Swelling in the wound area Sanguineous drainage in surgical drainHemorrhage When assessing a dressing always look and feel beneath the patient for pooled blood Can be caused by a slipped suture, clot, trauma to the site Apply pressure using sterile towels, monitor VS, and notify MD HEMATOMA • Tissue injury with pooling of blood under unbroken skin • May appear as swelling that is bluish red • May place pressure on blood vessels and obstruct blood flow to tissues • Client may have increased temperature Wound Drainage • Sanguineous • •Bloody • Serosanguineous • •Pink/Orange • Serous • •Yellow/clear Describe the difference between sanguineous, serous, and serosanguineous drainage. • Describe the difference between sanguineous, serous, and serosanguineous drainage. Sanguineous • Bloody • Serosanguineous • •Pink/Orange • Serous • •Yellow/clear Infection Most common type of wound complication Wound may be infected during surgery or postoperatively. Traumatic wounds are more likely to become infected Localized infection is an abscess: an accumulation of pus from debris Complications from Infections ▪ Cellulitis- Inflammation of tissue surrounding with redness and induration (skin hardening) ▪ Fistula-abnormal passage formed between 2 internal organs ▪ Sinus-fistula leading from infected cavity to outside of body Infection Signs and Symptoms • Increased pain • Redness • Warmth tissues • Purulent exudate (fluid containing cellular debris) Labs • Culture and sensitivity • Taken from the wound exudate (fluid/drainage) • Determine what type of organism is growing and what ABX can treat • WBC-Elevated Microorganisms • Discharge-White,yellow, pink, green • Staphylococcus aureus • E. Coli • MRSA (methicillin-resistent staphococcus aureus) • Pseudomonas aeruginosa Obtaining a Wound Culture • Use sterile gloves • Swirl distal end of culturette swab in the wound • Avoid the edges! • Send to lab Best Way to Prevent Wound Infection... ▪ Maintain strict asepsis when performing wound care! ▪ Use Sterile instruments ▪ Meticulous hand washing ▪ Sterile gloves ▪ Sterile dressings ▪ Refrain from talking while dressing Dehiscence & Evisceration Dehiscence – spontaneous opening of an incision. Evisceration – protrusion of an internal organ through the incision. Risk Factors for Dehiscence Obesity Poor Nutrition Mutiple Trauma Excessive Coughing Vomiting Strong Sneezing Dehydration Suture Failure Greatest risk for wound dehiscence is on 4-5 post-op day...before extensive collagen has been built. Evisceration Can lead to necrosis of intestines or overwhelming sepsis Pt may say “I feel like something just split open” Usually occurs suddenly Can have an increase in serosanguineous drainage before Evisceration-Immediate Care Supine Immediately place in supine position Place Place large sterile dressings over the viscera Soak Soak the dressings in sterile normal saline Notify Notify the surgeon immediately Prepare Prepare the patient for return to surgery-NPO Describe signs and symptoms of hemorrhage.
