Note: Social cognitive theory started as social learning theory in the 1960s by Albert Bandura. Social cognitive theory considers the unique way in which individuals acquire and maintain behavior, while also considering the social environment in which individuals perform the behavior. Major constructs of Social Cognitive Theory Reciprocal Determinism – refers to the dynamic and reciprocal interaction of person, environment, and behavior. Behavioral Capability – refers to a person’s actual ability to perform a behavior. Observational Learning – asserts that people can witness and observe behavior by others and then reproduce those actions. Reinforcements – refers to the internal or external responses to a person’s behavior. Expectations – refers to the anticipated consequences of a behavior. Self-efficacy – refers to the level of a person’s confidence in their ability to successfully perform a behavior. Albert Bandura (1925- ) is an American-Canadian psychologist who studied observational learning and proposed a theory of social learning. He proposed that both the environment and cognitive factors influence human learning. “The capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of life is the essence of humanness. Unless people believe they can produce desired results and forestall detrimental ones by their actions, they have little incentive to act or persevere in the face of difficulties.” – Albert Bandura, 2001","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
