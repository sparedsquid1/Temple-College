The release of histamine produces an inflammatory response. - 1st Gen Antihistamines Adverse reaction= Drowsiness - USES: . Relief if the symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergies . Allergic and vasomotor rhinitis . Allergic conjunctivitis . Mild and uncomplicated angioneurotic edema and urticaria . Relief of allergic reactions to drugs, blood, or plasma . Relief of coughs caused by colds and allergies . Adjunctive therapy in anaphylactic shock . Treatment of Parkinson-like symptoms . Relief of nausea & vomiting . Relief of motion sickness . Sedation . Adjuncts to analgesics - Adverse Reactions: - CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM REACTIONS: . Drowsiness or sedation . Disturbed coordination - RESPIRATORY SYSTEM REACTIONS: . Dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat . Thickening of bronchial secretions • 2nd Generation preparations (ex: Loratadine) causes less drowsiness and fewer anticholinergic effects than some of the other antihistamines. (A drug allergy that may occur with these drugs are a skin rash or Urticaria) ➢ Antitussives: Most depress the “Cough center” located in the medulla and are called “Centrally acting drugs”. - Fluid is unable to come out, used for a dry cough only, pooling is the biggest adverse reaction. - USES: . Used to relieve a NON-PRODUCTIVE cough. - Adverse Reactions: . Lightheadedness . Dizziness . Drowsiness or sedation . Secretions unable to come up and causes pulling ➢ Codeine: is an example of centrally acting antitussives. It is an Opioid antitussive. - USES: . It works peripherally by anesthetizing stretch receptors in the respiratory passages, thereby decreasing cough. - Used for an unproductive cough only - Adverse Reactions: . Sedation . Sweating . Headache . Dizziness . Lethargy . Confusion . Lightheadedness when other CNS depressants & alcohol may cause additive depressant effects when administered with antitussives containing codeine!! ➢ Dextromethorphan: also, an example of a centrally acting antitussive. It is a nonopioid antitussive. - USES: . Symptomatic relief of cough . Relieve a NON-PRODUCTIVE cough . Antitussive, it depresses cough center in medulla. ➢ Expectorant: A drug that THINS respiratory secretions to remove them more easily from the respiratory system. (Ex: Guaifenesin) - USES: . Used to help bring up respiratory secretions. . Used when the cough is dry and PRODUCTIVE. . Used to relieve cough with respiratory infections such as: - Sinusitis - Asthma - Bronchitis - Pharyngitis ➢ Xerostomia (Dry Mouth): - How to treat? . Frequently sipping water or other sugar-free fluids, chewing sugar-free gum, and using over- the-counter artificial saliva products may help keep the mouth moist. A room humidifier may also help. ➢ Nasal Decongestants Overuse: Overuse can cause “REBOUND” nasal congestion. This means the congestion becomes WORSE with the use of the drug. Educate patient to take the drug as it’s prescribed. Don’t take more than 2 weeks. ➢ Oxymetazoline (Afrin) Uses: Used for Nasal congestion. Nasal spray that reduces swelling and inflammation. - USED TO TREAT: . Common cold . Hay fever . Sinusitis . Allergic rhinitis . Congestion associated with rhinitis ➢ Albuterol: Wait 1 min between puffs, and wash mouth out after (or at risk for thrush). This is the drug you give for an emergency asthma attack. ➢ Bronchodilator: . You should NOT hear wheezing, or crackles because it opens up all the dilates the bronchioles (lumens) . Bronchospasm= Bronchioles are constricted meaning the lumen is decreased in size. ➢ Montelukast (Singulair): . This drug is a bronchodilator. Do NOT I repeat do NOT give to a patient with asthma. ➢ SABA (shot acting beta 2 agonist): . Activates sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight response). . Adverse reaction: High BP, dilation, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia. ➢ Antihyperlipidemic Drugs: . This could Increase the cholesterol levels. . Usually does NOT affect the pulse, BP, BUN, creatinine. . Allow 3 months for the medication to work and if it doesn’t contact the doctor and get off the medication and try something different. ➢ Cholestyramine: . BIGGEST side effect is CONSTIPATION. ➢ Cholesterol Levels: . HDL= is the GOOD healthy lipids . LDL= are BAD we want that level to go down ➢ Propranolol: . Take at the same time every day, same arm, same position. Educate the patient how to monitor their own BP. ➢ Atenolol: . Do NOT give Atenolol to a patient with Asthma. . ALWAYS take a set of vitals before administering this medication . If patient complains of occasional dizziness still continue to give the medication, but still notify the HCP. (New cardiac meds will cause temporary side effects) ➢ Nitroglycerin: . Take 1 dose every 5 minutes. Can have up to 3 doses, 15 min total. ➢ Verapamil: . Controls rate . Still give if the rate is normal, because it is MAINTAINING the rate. . Do NOT give if rate is below 60bpm. ➢ Nitrate: . Cardiac Med . Relieves chest pain . It dilates everything (opens it all up) ➢ Nitro Patch: . Place it on the chest close to the heart. . Place where there is no hair . Do not massage ➢ Heparin: . Anticoagulant . Monitor Labs such as aPTT levels . Antidote for a heparin overdose is PROTAMINE SULFATE ➢ Coumadin: Monitor labs such as PT/INR (Antidote is Vitamin K) ➢ Warfarin: Monitor labs such as PT/INR (Antidote is Vitamin K) ➢ Digoxin: . Increases the strength of Myocardial contraction, increases cardiac output and renal perfusion. . The therapeutic dose can cause toxicity (digitalis toxicity) . Adverse effects are vision changes, bradycardia, arrhythmias, YELLOW HALOS!! . Monitor your labs. . Do not give to patients with Hypokalemia or it could cause the patient to become susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias. . Signs & Symptoms of Digitalis Toxicity are: - N/V - Anorexia - Headache - Drowsiness (weakness) - Vision changes (A yellow halo around objects) - Bradycardia - Arrhythmias *If patients' pulse is lower than 60bpm hold the med. Check apical pulse after administration for 1 FULL MINUTES. ➢ Schedule B controlled substances: . LEAST abuse potential ➢ Schedule 1 controlled substances: . HIGHEST abuse potential ➢ An agonist taken with an Antagonist will cause them to cancel each other out. ➢ Idiosyncrasy: “WEIRD” reaction. Anything abnormal. ➢ SJS: skin rashes, mouth sores, skin lesions. ➢ Sulfonamides: . Treat UTIs, look for crystal in urine. . Increase fluids to 2000mls a day ➢ Anaphylactic Shock reactions: allergic reactions that includes hives, laryngeal edema, tachycardia, Tachypnea, hypotension, bronchospasm. ➢ Cefazolin: If patient is itching or has hives give Benadryl. Call the HCP to notify. ➢ Ceftriaxone: If you’re allergic to penicillin you’re allergic to this med as well. ➢ Aminoglycosides: Biggest side effect is tinnitus ➢ Nephrotoxicity: . Monitor I’s & O’s, BUN, creatinine ➢ Ferrous Sulfate: DO NOT give on top of antibiotics. Take the ferrous tablet 2 hrs before antibiotics or 2hrs after. Take with orange juice to help with absorption. ➢ Fluoroquinolones: . Biggest side effect is TENDON RUPTURE ➢ Super Infection: . C. Diff is the most common super infection (Diarrhea) ➢ Oseltamivir: Also known as “Tamiflu”.
