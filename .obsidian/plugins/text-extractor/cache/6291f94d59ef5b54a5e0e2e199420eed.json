EXAM 4 RESPIRATORY & FLUID/ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE CHAPTER 6 (20 questions) ❖ Fluid Balance: ➢ Intracellular fluid- Fluid inside the cells ➢ Extracellular fluid- Fluid outside the cells o Interstitial fluid- Is the water that surrounds the body's cells and includes lymph. o Intravascular fluid- Blood plasma, is the fluid within the arteries, veins, and capillaries. o Trans-cellular fluid- Those in specific compartments of the body. Such as cerebrospinal fluid, digestive juices, and synovial fluid in joints. ❖ Movement of fluids & Electrolytes: ➢ Active transport- ATP is where we get energy from. ➢ Passive transport- NO ENERGY o Diffusion: the movement of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. o Filtration: is the movement of both water and smaller molecules through a semipermeable membrane from an area of high pressure to an area of lower pressure. o Osmosis: is the movement of water from an area of lower substance concentration across a semipermeable membrane to an area of higher concentration ❖ Tonicity/Osmolarity: ➢ Isotonic: Same osmolarity as blood o Normal Saline 0.9% ➢ Hypertonic: Higher osmolarity than blood o Water leaves the cells and enters the blood stream ➢ Hypotonic: Lower osmolarity than blood o Water solution leaves the blood and other areas and enters the cell *Osmolarity- refers to the concentration of the substances in body fluids. The normal osmolarity of blood is between 270 and 300 milliosmoles per liter. ❖ Fluid Imbalances: ❖ Dehydration: o The most common form of dehydration results from loss of fluid from the body, resulting in decreased blood volume. ➢ Hypovolemia: o It occurs when the patient is hemorrhaging or when fluids from other parts of the body are lost. ➢ Causes of Hypovolemia: o Severe Vomiting & Diarrhea o Excessive wound drainage o Profusely sweating o NPO Status (Long term) o GI Suction ➢ Diagnostic Tests: o Elevated BUN o Elevated Hematocrit o Skin turgor o Cap refill. ➢ Interventions for Hypvolemia: o Replace fluids and resolve cause of dehydration o Isotonic fluids (0.9% NS) o Encourage fluid intake o Daily weights o Monitor I’s & O’s *Hypovolemia can also occur when fluid from the intravascular space moves into the interstitial fluid space. This process is called THIRD SPACING (common in burns, liver cirrhosis, extensive trauma) *If dehydration is not treated then the lack of sufficient blood volume causes organ function to decrease and eventually fail. *REMEMBER.. Healthy adults should urinate 30ml per hour S/S Of Hypovolemia: S/S Of Hypervolemia: Thirst Hypertension Rapid weak pulse BOUNDING pulse Rapid shallow respirations Increased, labored respirations Hypotension Distended Neck Veins Dry mucous membranes Pitting edema Poor skin turgor Polyuria Increased temp. Ascites (excess peritoneal fluid) Decreased urine output Dyspnea Weight loss Crackles in lungs ➢ Fluid Overload/Fluid Excess: o Sometimes called over-hydration, it is a condition in which a patient has too much fluid in the body. o Healthy adult kidneys can compensate for mild to moderate hypervolemia. o Typically, the kidneys increase urinary output to get the extra fluid off, however sometimes there are conditions where the kidneys cannot keep up with excess fluid. ➢ Causes of Hypervolemia/Fluid overload: o Poorly controlled IV therapy o Excessive ingestion of fluid o Can occur secondary to excessive sodium intake. o Adrenal gland dysfunction o Corticosteroid use ➢ Diagnostic Tests: o Decreased BUN o Decreased Hematocrit ➢ Interventions for Hypervolemia: o Diuretics o Sitting patient up in Semi-Fowler position o Oxygen therapy o Monitor oxygen o Strict I’s & O’s o Daily weights o Fluid restriction o Low sodium diets *Conditions that can result in inadequate excretion of fluid include kidney failure heart failure, and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH *Hypervolemia typically results in heart failure, due to the heart not being able to pump correctly causing pulmonary edema. *If a potassium sparing diuretic is prescribed, educate your patient to eat foods high in potassium ❖ Electrolyte Balance: 2 types of electrolytes ➢ Cations: Carry a positive electrical charge ➢ Anions: Carry a negative electrical charge ➢ Sodium Imbalances: o Normal sodium level is 135-145 o Sodium is a major Cation in the blood & helps maintain serum osmolarity o Sodium is important for cell function ➢ Hyponatremia: o Occurs when the sodium level is less than 135 o In an actual decrease, the patient has inadequate intake of sodium or excessive sodium loss from the body o In a relative decrease the sodium is not lost from the body, instead it may leave the intravascular space and move into the interstitial tissues. o Occurs with heat strokes and heat exhaustion o Occurs if a patient is NPO for too long ➢ Prevention for Hyponatremia: o Additional sodium is administered IV route o If it is a super active patient replace both sodium and water o Monitor the elderly closely o Stop diuretics o Antidiarrheal meds *Mental status changes occur due to the low sodium and decrease in osmolarity causes more “water pressure”. This causes water to collect in and around the brain, it causes ICP.

Failure o Decrease magnesium intake o Increase phosphate o Diuretics (Lasix) & Dialysis o Calcium gluconate is administered to block the increase of magnesium levels that can damage the heart *Signs & Symptoms are usually not apparent until the magnesium level is greater than 4. ➢ Acid-Base Balance: o An acid is a substance that release a hydrogen o A common acid in the body is hydrochloric acid o A base is a substance that binds hydrogen o A common base in the body is bicarbonate (HCO3) Alkali is another word for \"base”. ➢ Sources of Acids & Bases: o Acids are formed as end products of glucose, fat, and protein metabolism. o These are called fixed acids because they do not change once they are formed. o Carbonic acid is a weak acid that can be formed when the carbon dioxide resulting from cellular metabolism combines with water o . The pH of a solution can vary from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral, 0 to 6.99 being acid, and 7.01 to 14 being base, or alkaline. ➢ Control of Acid-Base Balance: o 3 major mechanisms are used: - Cellular buffers: Are first to attempt to return the pH to its normal range. (EX: Hemoglobin, Bicarbonate, phosphate) - The lungs: Blow off additional CO2 through rapid breathing - Kidneys: Are the slowest to respond to changes in serum pH taking as long as 24-48 hours to assist with compensation. Kidneys also reabsorb additional bicarbonate.

When the mucous membranes lining the bronchial tree become irritated and inflamed, excessive mucus is produced. o The result is congested airways o Acute bronchitis is usually an isolated episode caused by a virus o If bronchitis occurs more than 3 months out of the year for two consecutive years, chronic bronchitis is diagnosed. ❖ Bronchiectasis: The dilation of the bronchial airways. The dilated areas become flabby and scarred. Secretions pool in these areas and are difficult to cough up which causes an environment where bacteria can flourish, and infection is common. o Usually occurs secondary to another chronic respiratory disorder, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, TB, bronchitis, or exposure to a toxin. ➢ S/S: o Recurrent lower respiratory infections. o Sputum is copious and purulent o Extreme airway inflammation may cause sputum to be bloody. o Wheezes & crackles may be auscultated o Cubbing of the fingers may develop with chronic disease ➢ Diagnostic tests: o Chest X-ray o Sputum cultures o CT scan o Bronchoscopy ➢ Interventions: o Antibiotics may be used intermittently o Infection prevention o Flu & Pneumonia vaccines should be implemented if patient consents o Bronchodilators o Mucolytics o Expectorants o Bronchitol a form of mannitol, is an inhaled mucolytic that promotes mucus clearance. o Anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors reduce airway inflammation. o Oxygen is used if hypoxemia is present o Surgery may be considered to remove the diseased area ❖ Pneumonia(s): An acute inflammation and slash or infection of the lungs that occurs when an infectious agent enters and multiplies in the lungs of a susceptible person. o The most common cause of Community acquired bacterial pneumonias is Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called pneumococcal pneumonia. o Pneumonia can be seen on a Chest X-Ray ➢ Viral Pneumonia: Influenza viruses are the most common cause of viral pneumonia. o The presence of viral Pneumonia increases the patient's susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia. o Generally, patients with viral pneumonia are less ill than those with bacterial pneumonia. ➢ Aspiration Pneumonia: Some pneumonias are caused by aspiration of foreign substances. This most often occurs in patients with decreased levels of consciousness or an impaired cough or gag reflex. o These conditions can occur with alcohol ingestion, Stroke, General anesthesia seizures, Gastrointestinal reflux disease. ➢ Ventilator associated Pneumonia: VA P is a type of aspiration pneumonia that develops in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated. o The endotracheal tube keeps the glottis open, so secretions can be easily aspirated into the lungs. ➢ Chemical Pneumonia: Inhalation of toxic chemicals can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Which can lead to chemical pneumonia. o This increases the risk for subsequent bacterial infection. ➢ Prevention for Pneumonia(s): o Both flu and pneumonia vaccinations are essential to preventing pneumonia. o As the nurse Encourage patients to preform regular coughing, Deep breathing and position changes. Especially for the ones on bed rest or after surgery. o Also educate patients about the importance of hand hygiene, and infection control o VAP can be reduced with frequent mouth care using CHG. ➢ S/S of Pneumonia: o Fever o Shaking o Chills o Chest pain o Dyspnea o Fatigue o Productive cough o Crackles Purulent & wheezes o Older patients may experience new onset confusion or lethargy *Elderly patients are extremely at risk, especially at age 65 and over ➢ Complications with Pneumonia: o Other underlying chronic diseases o Pleurisy & Pleural Effusion are two of the MOST common complications (generally resolved within 1-2 weeks) o Atelectasis (collapsed alveoli) ➢ Interventions for Pneumonia(s): o Broad-Spectrum antibiotics are administered AFTER cultures are sent off to the lab. o Expectorants o Bronchodilators o Analgesics o Meter dosed inhalers may be prescribed o Supplemental Oxygen may be used if needed ❖ Tuberculosis (TB): Infectious disease caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis. o TB primarily affects the lungs, but the kidneys, liver, brain and bones may be affected also. o Mycobacterium is an acid-fast bacillus. Meaning when it is stained in the Lab and then washed with an acid, the stain remains or stays fast. o TB can live in dark places in dried sputum for months but killed in a few hours of direct sunlight. o It is spread by inhalation of the TB bacilli from respiratory droplets o TB infection without disease is called LATENT TB, during this time the body develops immunity, which keeps the infection under control ➢ Risk factors: o Crowded or poorly ventilated living conditions o Elderly population at risk o TB is also prevalent among the urban poor and minority groups ➢ S/S of TB: o Chronic productive cough o Blood-tinged sputum o Drenching night sweats o Chest pain o Poor appetite o Weight loss o Low grade fever *If effective treatment is NOT initiated, a downhill course occurs, with primary fibrosis, hemoptysis, and progressive weight loss *Spread of TB bacilli throughout the body can result in pleuritis, pericarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, bone & joint infections, or GI infections may occur. ➢ Diagnostic tests: o PPD skin test – Test is considered positive if a skin raises after 48-72 hours, a positive test results indicates that a person has been exposed to TB, it does not mean the person is infected with TB. o QFT-TB & T-SPOT are blood tests that detect the cell- mediated immune response to TB bacteria in Blood. ➢ Prevention for TB: o Clean well-ventilated living areas o If a patient is hospitalized for TB, place them on RESPIRATORY ISOLATION, with negative pressure isolation as well. (staff should wear high efficiency filtration masks) o TB vaccinations o Antibiotic therapy (Isoniazid, Rifampin, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide) o Medication must be taken for 6-9 months or up to 2 years for MDR-TB, because of the length of therapy and the incidence of side effects. adherence to therapy is often a problem. *Patients must be isolated until their symptoms no longer contains TB bacteria ❖ Pleurisy (Pleuritis): A small amount of serous fluid that prevents friction as the pleurae slides over each other during inhalation and exhalation. o If the membranes become inflamed for any reason, they do not slide easily. o This causes the characteristic sharp pain. On inspiration. The irritation causes an increase in the formation of pleural fluid. This in turn reduces friction and decreases pain o This usually is related to other underlying respiratory disorders ➢ S/S: o Sharp pain in the chest on inspiration o Breathing may be shallow and rapid (because deep breathing increases pain) o Fever o Chills o Elevated WBC count o Pleural friction rub is heard on auscultation *As pleural membranes become more inflamed, serous fluid production increases, which may result in pleural effusion. ➢ Diagnostic tests: o Auscultation of a pleural friction rub o Chest X-Ray o CT o Ultrasound o CBC ➢ Interventions: o NSAIDS o Opioids o The doctor may perform a nerve block by injecting anesthetic near the intercostal nerves to block transmission. ❖ Plural Effusion: When excess fluid collects in the pleural space o A normal amount of pleural fluid around each lung is 1-15ml. More than 25ml is considered abnormal. ➢ S/S: o SOB o Cough o Tachypnea o Dull sound is heard when the affected area is percussed o Lung sounds are decreased or absent over the effusion o Friction rub may be auscultated ➢ Interventions: o Bedrest o Severe symptoms may result in a thoracentesis. o Pleurodesis o Chest X-Ray o CT ❖ Empyema: Collection of pus in the pleural space.

Both conditions make it difficult for air to be removed from the alveoli, leading to trapping of air. o A patient with unremitting asthma is treated as having COPD. ➢ Chronic bronchitis: o symptoms occurring for at least 3 months of the year for two consecutive years Patients may have multiple exacerbations, each lasting 2 weeks or more. ➢ Emphysema: o Emphysema affects the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli distal to the terminal bronchioles causing destruction of the alveolar walls and loss of elastic recoil. ➢ S /S of COPD: o chronic cough with or with sputum production o Progressive dyspnea o Barrel shaped chest. o Crackles and wheezing are often noted on auscultation. o Progressive SOB (most common for emphysema) o Decrease mobility. o Polycythemia due to hypoxemia (causes ruddy skin color) ➢ Complications: o Some patients with emphysema develop a large air within the lung tissue (bullae) or adjacent to the pleurae (blebs). These are like blisters that can rupture and cause the lung to collapse. ➢ Interventions: o Reduce symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. o Encourage patient to quit smoking ➢ Medications: o Adrenergic o Anticholinergics o MDI’s o NMT’s o Corticosteroid inhalers *Antitussive agents should be avoided in COPD patients because they need to cough up secretions ❖ Asthma: chronic inflammation of the airways and hyper responsiveness of the bronchi, smooth muscles (bronchospasm) o Asthma is typically inherited o There is no prevention ➢ S/S of asthma: o Wheezing o Chest tightness o Dyspnea o Coughing o Tachypnea *Status asthmaticus occurs if bronchospasm is not controlled and symptoms are prolonged. ❖ Cystic Fibrosis: CF is a disorder of the exocrine glands that affects primarily the lungs, tract, and sweat glands. Abnormal sodium and chloride transport across cell membranes, causing thick, tenacious secretions, is responsible for many of the characteristic symptoms. o In the past, cystic fibrosis (CF) was thought to be just a childhood disease because most affected children did not survive past puberty. o Thick, sticky respiratory secretions are difficult to remove and cause airway obstruction, resulting in air trapping and frequent respiratory infections. o Patients with CF secrete sweat that is high in sodium and chloride because these electrolytes are not reabsorbed as they pass through the sweat ducts o CF is a genetic disorder, BOTH parents must be a carrier ➢ S/S of CF: o Symptoms usually first appear in infancy o Chronic sinusitis to production of thick sputum o Finger clubbing o Bouts of infection become more frequent with eventual loss of lung function o Respiratory failure o Frequent foul-smelling stools o Poor appetite o Bowel obstruction o Cirrhosis o Cholecystitis o Cholelithiasis *Chronic disease causes delayed sexual maturation in both male and female and infertility is common. ➢ Interventions: o No cure for CF o Controlling infection o Relieving symptoms o Removal of thick sputum is promoted with hydration o Inhaled beta antagonist bronchodilators o Lung transplant o Pulmonary rehabilitation o High doses of Ibuprofen may slow lung deterioration ❖ Pulmonary Embolism: Foreign object that travels through the blood stream, such as a blood clot, air, or fat. o To help prevent PE it is important to encourage the patient to regularly ambulate if able. ➢ S/S: o Suden onset dyspnea for no apparent reason o Tachycardia o Tachypnea o Cough o Chest pain o Auscultation may reveal crackles or friction rub o High BP ➢ Diagnostic tests: o D-dimmer o Spiral CT scan o Pulmonary angiogram o Chest X-Ray ➢ Interventions: o Thrombolytic agents (Alteplase) must be administered within 4-6hrs of the clot's occurrence. o Anticoagulants (heparin) o Cardiac Cath (to remove clot) o Surgical embolectomy o Long term anticoagulants o If clots keep recurring a filter will be placed into the inferior vena cava, the jugular or femoral vein to filter out clots from traveling to the heart or lungs ❖ Pneumothorax: Air trapped in the chest o If the pneumothorax occurs without an associated injury, it is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. o A traumatic pneumothorax results from a penetrating chest injury o If either the visceral pleura or the chest wall and parietal pleura are perforated, air will enter the pleural space, negative pressure will be lost, and the lung on the affected side will collapse ➢ Spontaneous Pneumothorax: o If no injury is present, the pneumothorax is considered spontaneous. This occurs mostly in tall, thin individuals and in smokers ➢ Traumatic pneumothorax: o Penetrating trauma to the chest wall and parietal pleura allows air to enter the pleural space ➢ Open pneumothorax: o If air can enter and escape through the opening in the pleural space ➢ Closed pneumothorax: o If air collects in the space and is unable to escape ➢ Tension pneumothorax: o In a closed pneumothorax, air, and therefore, tension, builds up in the pleural space and is unable to escape. ➢ S/S: o Sudden dyspnea o Chest pain o Tachypnea o Restlessness o Anxiety o Asymmetrical chest expansion on inhalation *Crepitus may occur when air leaks into subcutaneous tissues due to a pneumothorax or a leaking chest tube site. ➢ Diagnostic Tests: o Chest X-Ray o Ultrasound o CT scan ➢ Interventions: o Chest tube o Surgical repair o Small pneumothorax may absorb with no treatment ❖ Fail Chest: Part of the chest collapses with the negative pressure of inhalation and bulges with exhalation. This is called paradoxical respirations o Treat this condition with supplemental oxygen, analgesics, intubation or mechanical ventilation. ➢ S/S: o Chest movement that is opposite to that usually seen with respiration ➢ Priority nursing care: o Impaired gas exchange o Ineffective breathing pattern o Acute pain o Respiratory distress ❖ ARDS: Acute Resp. Distress Syndrome ➢ Causes: o Occurs because of acute lung injury o Most common cause is widespread sepsis o Pneumonia o Shock o Narcotic overdose o Aspiration ➢ S/S of ARDS: o Dyspnea o Tachypnea (causes respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation, then develops into acidosis as patient tires out) o Cyanosis o Fine inspiration crackles o Confusion and lethargy ➢ Complications: o Heart failure o Pneumothorax o DIC ➢ Interventions: o Cared for in ICU or PCU unit o Oxygen therapy (adjusted based off ABG results) o ABGs o Diuretics o IV fluids o Antibiotics o Intubation & mechanical ventilation Practice Questions: ➢ Define what an electrolyte is. ➢ What precautions/interventions should the nurse take with a patient that is Hypercalcemic? ➢ Abrupt onset of fever, chills, myalgia, sore throat, general malaise, and headache are symptoms of what disease process? ➢ What technique is used to keep airways open during exhalation, which promotes carbon dioxide excretion? ➢ What complications can occur if a patient has untreated strep throat? ➢ What is the movement of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration? ➢ What is the raised area called that a nurse is observing for after a TB test?
