Hepatotoxicity refers to [[Liver]] damage caused by chemicals. It can result from exposure to various substances, including medications, herbal supplements, industrial chemicals, and [[Alcohol]]. The [[Liver]] plays a crucial role in detoxifying harmful substances, but certain agents can overwhelm or damage [[Liver]] cells, leading to impaired function or [[Liver]] injury.

### Symptoms:
- **Early Symptoms:**
  - Fatigue
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Abdominal pain (especially in the upper right quadrant)
  - Loss of appetite
- **Advanced Symptoms:**
  - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
  - Dark urine
  - Pale stools
  - Itching
  - Swelling in the abdomen
  - Confusion or altered mental state ([[Hepatic encephalopathy]])

### Causes:
- **Medications:**
  - [[acetaminophen]] (in high doses or overdose)
  - Certain antibiotics (e.g., [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]])
  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]])
  - Statins
  - Antiepileptic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]
  - Chemotherapy agents
- **Herbal Supplements:**
  - Kava
  - Black cohosh
  - Certain Chinese herbal remedies
- **Industrial Chemicals:**
  - Carbon tetrachloride
  - Vinyl chloride
- **[[Alcohol]]:**
  - Chronic heavy drinking

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:**
  - Medical history and physical examination
- **[[Blood]] Tests:**
  - [[Liver]] function tests (elevated levels of enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin)
- **Imaging Studies:**
  - [[ultrasound]], CT scan, or MRI of the [[Liver]]
- **[[Liver]] Biopsy:**
  - In some cases, to assess the extent and type of [[Liver]] damage

### Treatment:
- **Discontinuation of the Causative Agent:**
  - Stopping the use of the offending drug or substance
- **Supportive Care:**
  - Hydration and nutrition support
- **Medications:**
  - N-[[acetylcysteine]] for [[acetaminophen]] overdose
  - Specific treatments for underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for [[hepatitis]])
- **Monitoring:**
  - Regular follow-up and [[Liver]] function tests

### Prevention:
- **Medication Management:**
  - Using the lowest effective doses and monitoring [[Liver]] function during therapy
- **Avoiding Excessive [[Alcohol]] Consumption:**
  - Limiting [[Alcohol]] intake to reduce the risk of [[Liver]] damage
- **Cautious Use of Herbal Supplements:**
  - Being aware of potential hepatotoxic effects of certain supplements

### Prognosis:
- **Depends on the cause, severity of [[Liver]] damage, and promptness of treatment.**
- **Mild cases often recover with proper management, while severe cases can lead to chronic [[Liver]] disease or acute [[Liver]] failure.**
