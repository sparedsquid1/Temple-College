## üìò Chapter 28 Summary: _The Child With a Gastrointestinal Condition_

### üîπ Overview
The gastrointestinal (GI) tract functions to metabolize and transport nutrients, stretching from the mouth to the anus. It involves enzymatic breakdown of food into absorbable nutrients.

### üîπ Diagnostic Procedures
Common tools to assess GI health:
- Lab tests: CBC, ESR, blood chemistry, stool cultures
- Imaging: Barium enema, ultrasound
- Invasive tests: Endoscopy, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy
