Here are the key characteristics of fetal development at 8, 17, and 25 weeks of [[gestation]]:

### **At 8 Weeks (End of Embryonic Stage)**
- **Size**: The fetus is about the size of a kidney bean (around 1/2 inch or 1.6 cm long).
- **Formation**: 
  - Major organs and systems begin to develop. The [[Heart]] is beating, and basic structures of the brain, [[Spinal cord]], and other parts of the nervous system are formed.
  - Facial features, like the eyes, nose, and ears, are starting to become distinct.
  - Limb buds (arms and legs) are more developed, and fingers and toes begin to form.
- **Movements**: Tiny, involuntary movements start, though the mother won’t feel them yet.
- **External Genitalia**: Although genitalia are starting to develop, it’s too early to tell the sex via [[ultrasound]].

### **At 17 Weeks (Second Trimester)**
- **Size**: The fetus is about 5 inches (13 cm) long and weighs about 5 ounces (140 grams).
- **Muscle and Bone Development**: The skeleton continues to harden from cartilage to bone, and muscle development is progressing, allowing more noticeable movements.
- **Movements**: The fetus begins to move more freely, and the mother may start feeling these movements, often referred to as "[[quickening]]."
- **Facial Development**: Eyebrows and eyelashes are starting to grow, and the fetus can make facial expressions like frowning.
- **Hearing**: The ears are fully developed, and the fetus can start to hear sounds from outside the womb.
- **Lanugo**: A fine layer of hair called lanugo covers the body to protect the skin and regulate temperature.

### **At 25 Weeks (End of Second Trimester)**
- **Size**: The fetus is about 13.5 inches (34 cm) long and weighs around 1.5 pounds (700 grams).
- **Lung Development**: The lungs are continuing to develop, although they aren’t fully mature. Surfactant production (needed for breathing after birth) has started, but the fetus would still require medical support if born at this stage.
- **Movements**: Fetal movements are stronger and more coordinated. The mother will feel frequent kicks and movements.
- **Sense Development**: 
  - The fetus can respond to sounds, and its hearing is well-developed.
  - The eyes begin to open, and they can sense light and darkness.
- **Skin**: The skin is still thin and translucent but becoming thicker as fat stores start to develop beneath it.
- **Brain Development**: The brain is growing rapidly, and neurons are forming connections that will help control vital functions such as breathing and heartbeat.

These milestones reflect the general progression of fetal development during the first and second trimesters.
