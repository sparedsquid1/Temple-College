takes longer to work but the chemical structure is what developed acetylsalicylic acid; has fewer adverse reactions; used cautiously with peptic ulcer disease o Reye’s Syndrome: life threatening condition manifested by vomiting and lethargy that can lead to a coma o When to discontinue: 1 week before any surgery or dental procedure; resume when complete healing has occurred o Administration ▪ Monitor for GI toxicity; bleeding, ulceration, and perforation; watch for black, dark, or bright red stools • Older adults are more at risk ▪ Take with food, milk, or full glass of water to prevent GI upset o Education: avoid alcohol, teach about toxicities s/s ▪ Salicylism: dizziness, tinnitus, impaired hearing, N/V/D, tachypnea, tachycardia, confusion, resp depression, coma (from large doses) ❖ Non-salicylates (Acetaminophen- APAP) (3 questions) o 2 actions: analgesic and antipyretic o Uses: mild-moderate pain and reduce fever, arthritis pains ▪ First choice for treating fever in children or with flu-like symptoms ▪ Used with pts who have bleeding disorders o Adult dosage range: those over 65 should limit to 3000mg/day; if liver is impaired then pt should limit not exceed over 2000mg/day ▪ Consistent alcohol drinkers: 1000-2000mg ▪ Teenager dose: max is 3250mg/day o Adverse reactions: urticaria, hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia (reduction of all blood components), hypoglycemia, jaundice, hepatoxicity, and hepatic failure o Contraindications: those taking salicylates or NSAIDS, hypersensitivity, diabetes ▪ Those who are malnourished and those who consume more than 3 alcoholic drinks on a daily basis have greater risk for developing liver damage (hepatotoxicity) ▪ Diabetes pts: acetaminophen may alter blood glucose levels (may cause falsely lowered levels) o S/S of poisoning: N/V, confusion, liver tenderness, hypotension, arrythmias, jaundice, and acute hepatic or renal failure ▪ Mainly affects liver and can cause damage or failure ▪ Antidote: acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) ▪ Treatment of overdose: induction of emesis or gastric lavage to remove unabsorbed drug from stomach Chapter 14: Nonopioid Analgesics (5 questions) ❖ Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)- Ibuprofen o 3 actions: analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory o Uses: mild to moderate pain, dysmenorrhea, fever, arthritis pains o Maximum adult dose: 3,200mg (3.2g) o Adverse reactions: stomatitis, jaundice, somnolence, polyuria, oliguria, dysuria, ecchymosis, purpura ▪ Adults over 65 are more at risk for severe adverse reactions (start with lower doses and then increase if needed) ▪ 2 most adversely affected body systems: gastric and cardiovascular o Celecoxib (Celebrex): inhibits COX-2 without inhibiting COX-2; relieves pain and inflammation without causing severe GI adverse reactions ▪ Does have an increased risk of CV thrombosis, MI, and stroke ▪ NOT FOR CABG patients (coronary artery bypass graft) for post-op pain o Herbal remedy: Capsicum (hot pepper) o Administration: take with full glass of water unless told otherwise ▪ If GI upset occurs, take with food or milk o Education: drive cautiously as NSAIDs may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or blurry vision; notify HCP if weight gain, visual disturbances, chest/leg pain occur, numbness, persistent headache, skin rash, or black stools occur ❖ Migrane headache drugs (sumatriptan) o Action: selective serotonin agonist that helps relieve acute pain (not prevent) o Uses: acute migraine, cluster headache pain o Adverse reactions: coronary artery vasospasm, arrythmias, tachycardia, MI ▪ CV system is major body system affected o Contraindications: pts who have ischemic heart disease (MI or angina), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), uncontrolled HTN, or those taking MAOIs ▪ Precaution with antidepressants (risk of serotonin syndrome) • Mental changes, tachycardia, HTN or fever, tight muscles, and difficulty walking ▪ If pt with migraine has PKU, educate about avoiding rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) o Administration: take at onset of migraine symptoms; don’t take more than 2 doses in a 24-hr period Chapter 15: Opioid Analgesics and Antagonists ❖ Opioid analgesics (8 questions) o Uses: moderate to severe acute/chronic pain, opioid dependence management o Adverse reactions: sedation, respiratory depression, increased ICP, urinary retention, and constipation o Contraindications: acute bronchial asthma, emphysema, upper airway obstruction, head injuries, or increased ICP, convulsions, renal/hepatic dysfunction, ulcerative colitis, pregnant or laboring women ▪ Use cautiously with older adults and pts who have not received opioids yet (“opioid naïve”- at greatest risk for respiratory depression) o Administration ▪ Assess vitals BEFORE and AFTER giving an opioid, especially respirations ▪ DO NOT GIVE if respiratory rate is less than 12 ▪ If respiratory rate drops after administration, arouse pt and coach their breathing; if it gets below 10 breaths/min, monitor more frequently and notify HCP immediately • Also get BP, pulse and respiratory rate before administering an antagonist ▪ Transdermal patches: only one patch at a time, discard old patched in toilet or sharps containers, label new patches, rotate sites, don’t apply over hair, hold for 10-20 seconds, only leave them on for 72 hours; be cautious with heat (teach about no heating pads over patch, no hot tubs, saunas, etc.) • Heat increases absorption rate of drug and can cause an overdose • Use cautiously with older adults as their subcutaneous tissue is reduced in the aging process ▪ Extended-release morphine or oxycodone: used for continuous around the clock, given every 8-12 hours, should be swallowed whole • May have fewer adverse reactions with oxycodone than with morphine sulfate ▪ Epidurals: lower total dosages which means fewer adverse reactions, can be bolus for continuous infusion • Risk for respiratory depression; why pts are monitored by apnea monitor for respiratory rate o Abstinence syndrome s/s: occurs when adults are withdrawing from methadone ▪ Early: yawning, tearing, runny nose, sweating ▪ Intermediate: pupil dilation, tachycardia, twitching, tremors, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, anorexia ▪ Late: muscle spasms, fever, nausea, vomiting, kicking, weakness, depression, body aches, weight loss, severe backache, abdominal and leg pains, hot and cold flashes, insomnia, repetitive sneezing, hypertension, tachypnea, and tachycardia o Patient controlled analgesia pump (PCA) ▪ Teach how pump works; only pt can press button ▪ Teach about button and call light; how they’re different ▪ Can be used to prevent pain; can use when they feel pain will come on ▪ Only need to press button once ▪ If pressed too quickly, pt won’t receive pain meds; no risk for overdose ❖ Nursing Diagnoses o Altered breathing pattern R/T pain and effects on breathing center: teach about coughing and deep breathing every 2 hours, encourage ADLs o Injury risk R/T dizziness or light-headedness: possible orthostatic hypotension, teach about rising slowly ▪ Miosis (pinpoint pupils) can cause difficulty seeing; have pt call for assistance when getting up out of bed o Constipation R/T decreased GI motility: administer stool softener of laxative and increase fluid intake o Malnutrition R/T anorexia: note food intake, administer possible supplemental nutrition o Impaired self-ventilation R/T brain response to slow breathing (with naloxone): use cardiac monitoring, oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, have suction readily available to maintain airway o Acute pain R/T antagonist drug displacing opioid drug at cell receptor sites: remember how pain will come back immediately, monitor fluid intake and output ❖ Drug tolerance: physical adaptation to drug; greater amounts are needed to achieve the same effects ❖ Physical dependence: when the body experiences adverse effect when medication is stopped ❖ Opioid antagonists: naloxone (Narcan) (2 questions) o Uses: reverse respiratory depression, treat opioid addiction, opioid overdose o Adverse reactions: N/V, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, tremor ▪ Remember pain will come back IMMEDIATELY o Administration: given slowly by IV push; if given too quickly, withdrawal and intense pain will be manifested by pt ▪ Vitals every 5-15 minutes after giving antagonist and noticing a response Module V Chapter 40: Antidiabetic Drugs (8 questions) ❖ Diabetes o Glucose: essential for cells to produce energy; produced by alpha cells of pancreas ▪ Normal adult range: 60-100 mg/dL ▪ Test using a glucometer: teach about cleaning and drying finger, prick side of finger, do not smear blood • Urine testing isn’t used anymore (it plays a role in identifying kidney involvement or ketone excretion and would need to use the second void, 30 minutes after first void; simply it would take too long) • A1C test: glycosylated hemoglobin test that monitors the average BG level throughout a 3-4 month period; evaluates how successful diabetes treatment is; best way to monitor long term control o Normal levels are 6.5-7% (indicated good control) o Poor control: 10% or greater o Insulin: hormone produced by beta cells of pancreas; lowers BG levels by inhibiting glucose production; stimulates synthesis of glycogen by liver and promotes protein synthesis and helps body store fat by preventing its breakdown for energy o Type I: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); harder to manage o Type II: non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); more common ▪ Risk factors: obesity, older age (>40), family hx, gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, limited physical mobility, race/ethnicity ▪ Can be controled with diet, exercise, and oral antidiabetic drugs o Pregnancy: makes diabetes more difficult to manage ▪ Insulin requirements usually decreases in first tri then increases during second and third o Major symptoms: polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), and polyuria (increased urination); also weight loss ❖ Insulin products o Onset: when insulin first acts in body (make sure pt has food by this time) o Peak: when insulin exerts its max action o Duration: length of time the insulin remains in effect Category Example Onset Peak Duration Rapid-acting Regular Insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R) 30-60 min 2-4 hr 5-8 hr Rapid-acting Insulin Lispro (Humalog) 5-10 min 30 min-1 hr 3-5 hr Intermediate NPH Insulin (Humulin N or Novolin N) 1.5 hr 4-10 hr 14 hr Long-acting Insulin Glargine (Lantus) 1 hr none 24 hr o Uses: replacement for insulin (T1DM), supplements insulin (T2DM), DKA, and hypokalemia with glucose o Adverse reactions ▪ Hypoglycemia (caused by eating too little, too much insulin): less than 60mg/dL, fatigue, weakness, nervousness, agitation, confusion, headache, diploplia, convulsions, dizziness, unconsciousness, hunger, nausea, pale, moist, cool, diaphoretic, numbness, tingling lips or tongue • “cold, clammy, give them candy” ▪ Hyperglycemia (caused by eating too much, too little insulin, stress, infection, surgery, pregnancy, acute illness): more than 200mg/dL, drowsiness, dim vision, deep and rapid respirations, thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dry/flushed skin, rapid/weak pulse, acetone breath, excessive urination (polyuria) o Contraindications (drugs that affect hypoglycemic effect) ▪ Drugs than may cause the requirement of more insulin: calcitonin, diuretics, epinephrine, estrogens, glucagon, progesterone ▪ Drugs that may cause the requirement of less insulin: calcium, MAOIs, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, ACE inhibitors, alcohol o Mixing insulins: CLOUDY, CLEAR, CLEAR, CLOUDY/ LONG, SHORT, SHORT, LONG ▪ Air into long-acting, air into rapid-acting, then draw up regular insulin first, then the long-acting • Rapid-acting= short-acting ▪ NEVER mix or dilute glargine (intermediate) with any other insulin or solution o Administration ▪ Always use insulin syringes ▪ Cannot be given orally (it’s a protein and readily destroyed in GI tract) • Regular insulin is the only type that can be given IV ▪ Rotate sites (to prevent lipodystrophy: atrophy of subcutaneous fat; appears like “dimpled skin”) • This problem can interfere with absorption of insulin ▪ Monitor for effectiveness of insulin (make sure BG levels came down but didn’t get too low) o Treating a hypoglycemic reaction (acute confusion) ▪ 4 ounces of orange juice or other juice ▪ Hard candy or one tbsp of honey ▪ Glucose gel or tablets ▪ Glucagon injection or IV (acts by increase BG levels by stimulation of conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver ▪ Glucose 10% or 50% IV ▪ REMEMBER, never give oral meds or fluids if gag and swallowing reflex is absent o Treating dehydration (hypovolemia) ▪ Occurs with DKA; when insulin is unavailable to allow glucose to enter cell; dangerously high levels of insulin build up in blood (hyperglycemia) ▪ S/S: (mentioned above); over 200 mg/dL ▪ Treatment: fluids, correction of acidosis and hypotension, low doses of regular insulin o Maintaining anxiety within a patient ▪ Educate about important of diet, weight control, activity ▪ Maintain and set goals and boundaries ❖ Oral antidiabetic drugs o Biguanides (Metformin) ▪ Use: T2DM, prediabetics (helps maintain BG levels) ▪ Adverse reactions: N/V, diarrhea, increased flatulence (take with food to minimize GI upset) ▪ Temporarily pause for surgical procedures ▪ Increased risk for lactic acidosis when given with glucocorticoids (altered breathing problem) • Normal muscle by-product of exercises when cells don’t receive enough oxygen; occurs when lactic acid builds up quicker than its able to be excreted • S/S: malaise, abdominal pain, tachypnea, SOB, muscular pain; cardiovascular collapse if not recognized in time • Elevated blood lactate levels: exceeds 5 mmol/L o Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Agonists (Semglutide or “Ozempic”) ▪ Use: T2DM (stimulates insulin release when one eats, reduces glucagon and slows gastric emptying) ▪ Adverse effects: GI in nature ▪ Can be given orally in morning at least 30 minutes before breakfast ▪ Prolongs bleeding if given with vitamin K ▪ Reduces effectiveness of oral contraceptives o Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter-2 Inhibitors ▪ Use: lowers renal glucose threshold so glucose can be excreted • Pt may experience a drop in A1C, weight, systolic BP, and LDLs ▪ Adverse effects: yeast infections (due to excessive excretion of glucose), bacterial infection called “necrotizing fasciitis” (rare but serious) ▪ Monitor for perineal itching, pain, redness, swelling, general malaise or fatigue, and a fever of 100.4 or greater ▪ Take at same time each day o Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors ▪ Use: T2DM (enhanced secretion of incretin hormone produced by body which reduces glucagon and lowers BG levels) ▪ Adverse effects: headache, respiratory tract issues (nasopharyngitis) ▪ NOT FOR DKA (T1DM) o Thiazolidinediones ▪ Use: T2DM (improves insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells; also inhibits gluconeogenesis- formation of glucose from glycogen) • Pt may experience significantly lowered A1C ▪ Adverse effects: weight gain and hypoglycemia o Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors ▪ Use: prevents the after-meal surge in BG levels (delays digestion absorption of carbohydrates in intestine) ▪ Adverse effects: bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea (increase dose slowly to decrease side effect) ▪ Take 3x a day at first bite of food (it increases absorption) o Amylinomimetic ▪ Use: mimics amylin (a hormone produced by pancreas that helps delay gastric emptying and decreases glucagon release which overall decreases appetite) • Pt may experience a drop in A1C and may lose weight ▪ Greater risk for severe hypoglycemic reaction when given with insulin (pramlintide) • Make sure these drugs are given as separate injections and never mixed in same syringe o Sulfonylureas ▪ Use: T2DM (stimulates beta cells of pancreas to release insulin) ▪ Take with food to prevent GI upset ▪ Glipizide: take 30 minutes before meal o Meglitinides ▪ Use: T2DM (stimulates the release of insulin from pancreas) ▪ Known to be more rapid with a shorter duration (taken 3 times a day) ▪ Adverse effects: upper respiratory issues (bronchitis, rhinitis), back pain, headache Chapter 41: Pituitary and Adrenocortical Hormones (7 questions) ❖ Pituitary gland (master gland) o Two lobes: anterior (adenohypophysis) and posterior (neurohypophysis) ❖ Posterior pituitary hormones (vasopressin)-just know class of medication o Action: regulates reabsorption of water by kidneys (alongside desmopressin); also has some vasopressor activity o Uses: Diabetes insipidus (DI)- failure of pituitary to secrete vasopressin or pituitary gland has been removed; also used for post-operative abdominal distension ▪ Characterized by marked increase in urination (10L in 24 hours) and increased thirst o Adverse reactions: tremors, sweating, vertigo, nasal congestion, water intoxication (overdosage) ▪ Water intoxication: fluid overload that causes drowsiness, listlessness, confusion, headache; notify HCP; fluids or diuretic may be necessary o Administration/monitoring ▪ Monitor for dehydration (dry mucosa, concentrated urine, poor skin turgor, flushing, dry skin, confusion) ▪ Make sure patient wears an armband that signifies they have DI ▪ Assess pt’s BP, pulse, and respiratory rate Q4 hours, strict I/Os • Monitor every 10-15 minutes after giving medication o Abdominal pain (acute pain) ▪ Auscultate abdomen Q 15-30 minutes; measure abdominal girth Q hour ❖ Anterior Pituitary Hormones (Somatropin) o Uses: pituitary growth hormone deficiency o Administration: GIVE SUBQ ▪ Give at bedtime to adhere to body’s natural release of the hormone (to work with hormone) ▪ Monitor GH levels, glucose tolerance, and thyroid function o Pt will be a child (may be at risk for disturbed body image) ❖ Anterior Pituitary Hormones (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) o Use: stimulates adrenal cortex to produce and secrete adrenocortical hormones, primarily glucocorticoids ❖ Adrenocortical Hormones (Glucocorticoids) o Effect on immune system: decreases production of lymphocytes and eosinophils by atrophy of thymus gland; blocks cytokines from being released; decreases B and T lymphocytes ▪ Why it’s good for post-transplant patients o Has huge anti-inflammatory action o Uses: endocrine disorders, rheumatic disorders, collagen diseases, dermatology issues, allergies, ophthalmic diseases, respiratory issues, hematologic problems, neoplastic diseases, edematous states, GI diseases, nervous system disorders o Adverse reactions: fluid and electrolyte imbalance, musculoskeletal disturbances, cardiovascular problems, GI disturbances, dermatologic problems, neurologic disorders, endocrine issues, ophthalmic problems, metabolic issues o May precipitate hyperglycemia, if patients have hidden diabetes ▪ May require more frequent adjustment of dosage ▪ Check blood glucose levels frequently o NO LIVE VACCINES (the vaccine can potentiate virus replication with ACTH, increase adverse reaction to vaccine, and decrease antibody response to vaccine) o DO NOT OMIT DOSE (needs to be given before 9am to precent adrenal suppression) o Alternate day therapy: for long-term therapy; give twice the daily dose every other day before 9am o Monitor for infections (with glucocorticoids, decreased resistance to infection) ▪ S/S of infection: temperature, sore throat o Monitor for GI bleeding (possible peptic ulcers) ▪ S/S: black or tarry stool, epigastric burning or pain, bloody or coffee ground emesis ▪ Give with full glass of water to decrease GI irritation o Monitor electrolytes and fluid balance (fluid overload)- especially prednisone ▪ S/S: edema, weight gain ▪ Monitor strict intake and output, restrict sodium, elevate extremities, possibly get a dietician involved Extra: Dosage Calculations: 5 / Antiprotozoal: 1 / Cholinergic Blockers: 1 / DMARDS: 1 / Gout: 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
