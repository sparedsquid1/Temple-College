The **VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory)** test is a [[Blood]] test used to screen for **syphilis**, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*. The test detects the presence of antibodies that the body produces in response to the infection.

### Key Points:
- **Non-specific**: The VDRL test doesn't detect the syphilis bacteria itself but looks for antibodies that may indicate syphilis. These antibodies are not unique to syphilis, so false positives can occur.
- **Confirmatory tests**: If the VDRL test is positive, additional specific tests, like the **FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption)** test, are used to confirm the diagnosis.
- **Used for screening**: It is commonly used for routine screening in prenatal care and [[Blood]] donation or when there is a suspected infection.
- **Monitoring disease**: The VDRL test can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for syphilis, as the antibody levels tend to decrease with successful therapy.

### Limitations:
- The test may not detect very early or late-stage syphilis.
- False positives can occur in conditions such as lupus, pregnancy, and certain viral infections.
