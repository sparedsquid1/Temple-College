 Illness [[anxiety]] Disorder, also known as Hypochondria, is a mental health condition characterized by an excessive preoccupation with having or developing a serious illness. Individuals with this disorder often misinterpret normal bodily sensations as signs of a severe medical condition, leading to persistent worry and fear. They may frequently seek medical attention, undergo numerous tests, and engage in excessive health-related behaviors, such as excessive handwashing or checking for symptoms. This disorder can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, relationships, and daily functioning. Treatment typically involves cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and sometimes medication to help manage symptoms and reduce [[anxiety]].
