### **Summary of Chapter 48: Nursing Care of Patients with Central Nervous System Disorders**

This chapter covers essential aspects of **central nervous system (CNS) disorders**, including infections, injuries, and neurodegenerative conditions. Below is a structured summary of the key concepts discussed:

#### **1. CNS Infections**

- [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=6&selection=2,0,2,10|Meningitis]]: Infection/inflammation of the brain and spinal cord caused by bacterial or viral agents. Symptoms include severe headache, fever, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, and positive [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=9&selection=2,0,4,20|Kernig and Brudzinski signs]].
- [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=13&selection=2,0,2,12|Encephalitis]]: Inflammation of brain tissue, often viral in origin (e.g., West Nile, herpes simplex). Symptoms include Headache • Fever • Nausea and vomiting • Nuchal rigidity • Confusion • Decreased level of consciousness (LOC) • Seizures • Photophobia • [[ataxia]] • [[Hemiparesis]] • Tremors • Coma • Death

#### **2. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=19&selection=2,0,2,31|Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)]]**

- Causes: Brain trauma, tumors, hemorrhage.
- Symptoms: Decreased LOC, pupil changes, [[Cushing's triad]].
- Management: ICP monitoring, osmotic diuretics, and controlled ventilation.
- Monitoring: External ventricular drain, [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=23&selection=2,0,2,31|Intraparenchymal monitor & Subarachnoid bolt]]

#### **3. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=25&selection=2,0,2,17|Headaches]]**

- **Primary**: Migraine, tension, cluster.
- **Secondary**: Due to trauma, infection, or other medical conditions.
- **Management**: Pain assessment, identifying triggers, stress management.

#### **4. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=29&selection=2,0,2,8|Seizures and Epilepsy]]**

- **Partial seizures**: Begin on one side of the brain.
- **Generalized seizures**: Affect both hemispheres, including tonic-clonic and absence seizures.
- **Status epilepticus**: Continuous seizure activity requiring emergency intervention with **lorazepam or diazepam**.

#### **5. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=38&selection=2,0,2,22|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)]]**

- Causes: **Motor vehicle collisions, falls, assaults.**
- Types: Concussion, contusion, hematoma (subdural, epidural).
- Management: Surgery, ICP control, therapeutic coma.

#### **6. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=48&selection=2,0,2,11|Brain Tumors]]**

- **Primary or metastatic** tumors can cause ICP, motor/sensory deficits, and personality changes.
- Treatment: Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy.

#### **7. [[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=66&selection=2,0,2,18|Spinal Cord Injury]]**

- **Cervical injury**: Can cause quadriplegia, respiratory impairment.
- **Thoracic/lumbar injury**: May result in paraplegia.
- **Spinal shock**: Loss of autonomic function, leading to hypotension, bradycardia, and urinary retention.
- **Emergency care**: Immobilization, airway protection, and preventing complications.

#### **8. Neurodegenerative Disorders**

- **[[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=84&selection=2,0,4,7|Parkinson’s disease]]**: Characterized by tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity due to dopamine deficiency.

- **[[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=97&selection=2,0,4,7|Alzheimer’s disease]]**: Progressive memory loss due to neurofibrillary tangles and plaques.
- **[[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=76&selection=2,0,2,8|Dementia]]**: Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function, affecting memory, thinking, and daily activities, often caused by various diseases, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common type.
- **[[Nrsg Hlth & Ill Chapt 48.pdf#page=83&selection=2,0,2,8|Delirium]]**: Temporary mental disturbance

#### **9. Nursing Care**

A. Monitor for fever.  
B. Maintain a patent airway.  
C. Assess for memory loss.

A. High-protein diet  
B. Small, frequent meals  
C. Low-sodium diet  
D. High-fiber diet

**Answer:** B. Small, frequent meals  
**Rationale:** **Levodopa absorption is reduced by high protein intake**, so **small, frequent meals** prevent interactions.

---

**Question:** How should a nurse communicate with a patient in stage 2 Alzheimer’s disease?  
A. Use complex explanations.  
B. Give short, simple instructions.  
C. Encourage abstract thinking.  
D. Avoid repeating information.

**Answer:** B. Give short, simple instructions.  
**Rationale:** **Patients with Alzheimer’s struggle with comprehension**, so **short, direct instructions** are best.
