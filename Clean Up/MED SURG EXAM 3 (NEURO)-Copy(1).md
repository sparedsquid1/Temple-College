MED SURG EXAM 3 (NEURO) Chapter 47: Nervous System Function, Data Collection, and Therapeutic Measures (2 questions) ❖ Two divisions of the nervous system o Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) o Peripheral nervous system (autonomic nervous system) ❖ Types of neurons o Afferent: sensory neuron o Efferent: motor neuron o Interneuron: between afferent and efferent) ❖ Neuron structure o Cell body: “soma”; control center and contains nucleus o Dendrites: receive signals from other neurons and conduct info to cell body o Axon: carries nerve signals away from body; longer than dendrites o Myelin sheath: encases most axons; mostly contains lipids for insulation o Neurofibril nodes (nodes of Ranvier): gaps in myelin sheath at even intervals o Synaptic knob: end of axon terminal ❖ Nerve impulses: action potential; change in electrical signal of neuron ❖ Synapse: allows impulse transmission to become a chemical one ❖ Spinal nerves: 31 pairs total o 8 cervical: chest, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, and diaphragm o 12 thoracic: intercostal muscles of ribcage, abdominal muscles, back muscles o 5 lumbar: lower abdominal wall and parts of thighs and legs o 5 sacral: thighs, buttocks, skin of legs and feet, anus, genitalia o 1 coccygeal ❖ Spinal cord reflex: usually fast, involuntary, automatic, and predictable; uses a neural circuit (called a “spinal reflex arc”) o Withdrawal reflex: stimulus is painful trauma to tissue and response is pulling away ❖ Spinal cord structure o CSF: circulates in subarachnoid space o White matter: abundance of myelin; contains axon bundles (tracts) that carry impulses to different parts of nervous system o Gray matter: lack of myelin; contains mostly motor neurons and interneurons; 2 sets of horns; posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) ❖ Brain: contain meninges (3 layers of connective tissue that covers CNS) o Cerebrum: 2 cerebral hemispheres (4 lobes each) ▪ Frontal lobe: in charge of voluntary movement; initiative, emotion, judgement, reasoning, conscience • Left hemisphere: Broca's motor speech ▪ Temporal lobe: in charge of sensory areas; hearing and olfaction (smell), visual recognition • Left side: Wernicke's aera (also on left parietal lobe too) ▪ Parietal lobe: receives, perceives, and interprets somatic senses and taste ▪ Occipital lobe: visual area that receive and interpret sight o Diencephalon ▪ Thalamus: filters sensory input ▪ Hypothalamus: suspends pituitary gland from a stalk (infundibulum) o Brainstem ▪ Midbrain: reflex center that regulates visual, auditory, and righting reflexes ▪ Pons: 2 respiratory centers that work with medulla oblongata to produce normal sinus rhythm ▪ Medulla oblongata: lies superior to spinal cord; regulates vital life functions ▪ Cerebellum: posterior to brainstem; involuntary aspect of voluntary movements (coordination, appropriate direction/movement endpoints, and maintaining posture) Functions of autonomic nervous system Organ Sympathetic response: dominant in stressful situations-fear, anger, anxiety Parasympathetic system: Dominant when relaxed- stress fee to promote normal functioning of several organ systems Heart (cardiac muscle) Increases rate Decreases rate (to normal) Bronchioles (smooth muscle) Dilate Constrict (to normal) Iris (smooth muscle) Dilate pupil Constrict pupil (to normal) Salivary glands Decrease secretion Increase secretion (to normal) Stomach and intestines (smooth muscle) Decrease peristalsis Increase peristalsis for normal digestion Stomach and intestines (glands) Decrease secretion Increase secretion for normal digestion Internal anal sphincter Contract to prevent defecation Relax to permit defection Urinary bladder (smooth muscle) Relax to prevent urination Contract for normal urination Internal urethral sphincter Contract to prevent urination Relax to permit urination Liver Change glycogen to glucose None Sweat glands Increase secretion None Blood vessels in skin and viscera (smooth muscle) Constrict None Blood vessel in skeletal muscle (smooth muscle) Dilate None Adrenal glands Increase secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine None ❖ Glasgow coma scale o 15 or greater: best possible response o 13-14: mild head injury o 9-12: moderate injury o 8 or below: severe head injury (<7 means pt is comatose) o Terms to remember ▪ Decorticate: FLEXTION;
