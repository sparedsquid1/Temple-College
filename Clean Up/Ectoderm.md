The **ectoderm** is one of the three primary germ layers in the early embryo that gives rise to various tissues and structures in the body. During early embryonic development, the embryo differentiates into three layers: ectoderm, [[Mesoderm]], and [[Endoderm]].

### **Functions and Derivatives of the Ectoderm**
The ectoderm primarily forms tissues that are related to the body's outer structures and the nervous system. Key structures derived from the ectoderm include:

1. **Skin and Related Structures**:
   - **Epidermis** (outer layer of the skin)
   - Hair, nails, and sweat glands
   - [[Teeth]] enamel

2. **Nervous System**:
   - **Brain and [[Spinal cord]]** ([[CNS]])
   - Peripheral nerves
   - **Neural crest cells**, which give rise to various specialized tissues like the [[Cranial Nerves]], melanocytes (pigment-producing cells), and facial cartilage.

3. **Sensory Organs**:
   - The **eyes** (including the lens and cornea)
   - **Ears** (outer and inner ear structures)
   - Nose (olfactory structures)

4. **Glandular Tissues**:
   - The **pituitary gland**
   - The **adrenal medulla**

The ectoderm plays a vital role in the formation of structures that protect the body and allow it to interact with the environment.
