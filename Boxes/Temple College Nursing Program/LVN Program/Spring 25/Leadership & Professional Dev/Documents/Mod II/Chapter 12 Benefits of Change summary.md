[[Chapter 12]], "Understanding the Benefits of Change" by [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Contacts/Audra Xenakis|Audra Xenakis]], DNP, RN, discusses the concept of change in healthcare settings. The chapter begins by emphasizing that change is essential for growth and development in nursing practice, patient care, and organizational improvement. 

The author introduces Kurt Lewin's Change [[theory]], which comprises three phases: Unfreezing, Moving, and Refreezing. In the Unfreezing phase, individuals are prepared for change by considering driving (motivating) forces and restraining forces that influence behavior. This stage involves unlearning old patterns and creating a readiness to accept new ones.

During the Moving phase, people experience an imbalance or hyperenergy due to the change, which indicates a willingness to adapt. Support is crucial during this time to maintain open communication and address feedback about the change.

Refreezing refers to formalizing changes through support systems such as new policies, training for new employees, and periodic evaluations. The chapter also highlights the role of an LVN (Licensed Vocational Nurse) in implementing change as a "change agent." LVNs can work closely with managers to bring about planned changes by committees or administrative groups.

The text further explains that unplanned or drift-based changes, often met with resistance, should ideally be defined and planned for by nurses themselves. It also discusses the importance of evidence-based practice in delivering optimal patient care and facilitating transitions through various life phases.

In summary, "Understanding the Benefits of Change" underscores the significance of change in healthcare settings, outlines Kurt Lewin's Change [[theory]] for effective implementation, and emphasizes the role of LVNs as change agents in promoting growth and development in nursing practice.
