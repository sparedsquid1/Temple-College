[[Monoamine]] Oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the breakdown of [[monoamine]]s, which are neurotransmitters such as [[Dopamine]], serotonin, norepinephrine, and [[Epinephrine]]. MAO helps regulate the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain and peripheral tissues by catalyzing their oxidative deamination.

There are two types of [[Monoamine]] Oxidase:

1. **MAO-A**: Primarily breaks down serotonin, norepinephrine, and [[Epinephrine]]. It is found in various tissues, including the brain and intestines.
2. **MAO-B**: Mainly breaks down phenylethylamine and certain other trace amines. It is predominantly found in the brain and platelets.

MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of medications that inhibit the activity of [[Monoamine]] oxidase enzymes, thereby increasing the levels of [[Monoamine]] neurotransmitters. These medications are used in the treatment of certain psychiatric conditions, such as [[Depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]], though they can have significant interactions with certain foods and other medications.
