The nurse is preparing to administer sulfadiazine to a client who is also taking warfarin. The nurse would be alert for which potential adverse effect? A) Prolonged clotting times B) Increased risk of infection C) Decreased antibiotic effect D) Decreased white blood cell count Answer: A Rationale: When warfarin and sulfonamides are given concomitantly, an increase in action of the anticoagulant is seen, leading to an increase in clotting time, such as PT/INR, and an increased risk of bleeding. An increased risk of infection and a decrease in the white blood cell count would occur when a sulfonamide is given with methotrexate. The combination of warfarin and sulfonamide does not impact the effect of the antibiotic.

A nurse is to administer sulfasalazine to a client with ulcerative colitis. Which interventions would be most important while caring for this client? A) Stop dosage if skin turns orange-yellow color. B) Regularly inspect client's stool samples. C) Give the drug on an empty stomach. D) Administer cranberry juice to the client. Answer: B Rationale: While providing care to a client receiving sulfasalazine therapy for ulcerative colitis, the nurse should regularly inspect all stool samples and record their number and appearance. Yellow skin or urine in clients receiving sulfasalazine is normal, and the nurse should not stop the dosage. Sulfasalazine is administered with meals or immediately afterward, not on an empty stomach. Administering cranberry juice is helpful for clients with urinary tract infections, but not for clients with ulcerative colitis.

An elderly client receiving treatment for a urinary tract infection is now reporting diarrhea. On assessment, the nurse notes the client has been receiving the appropriate medication as well as drinking cranberry juice. Which factor is most likely the cause of the client's condition? A) Extremely large dosage of cranberry juice B) Lack of activity or exercise C) Occurrence of crystalluria D) Minimized food and fluid intake Answer: A Rationale: Clients may develop gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea if they have consumed extremely large doses of cranberry juice. The recommended dose is 6 oz of juice twice daily. Cranberry juice on an empty stomach or immediately after dosage will not lead to diarrhea if taken in the recommended amount. Minimized food and fluid intake or lack of exercise does not increase the chances of diarrhea. Crystalluria does not cause diarrhea.

A nurse is about to administer mafenide to a client. The nurse would be alert for which possible reaction? A) Rash, itching, or other allergic reactions B) Crystals in the urine sample C) Inflammation of the mouth D) Loss of appetite Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should assess for allergic reactions such as rash, itching, edema, and urticaria when administering mafenide. Topical sulfonamides like mafenide do not cause crystalluria, inflammation of the mouth, or loss of appetite.

After administering sulfonamides to a client, the nurse observes the client has developed a fever, cough, and muscular aches, as well as lesions in the form of red wheals on the neck and the mouth. The nurse interprets these findings as indicating which possible adverse reaction? A) Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) B) Anaphylactic shock C) Thrombocytopenia D) Leukopenia Answer: A Rationale: Clients with SJS may report fever, cough, muscular aches and pains, and headache. Additional signs include lesions on the neck and mouth. Lesions are not symptoms of leukopenia or anaphylactic shock. A client with thrombocytopenia develops bruises on the skin but not lesions in the form of red wheals.

The health care professional has recommended sulfonamide therapy for a client who is currently taking oral anticoagulants. What are the possible effects of combining sulfonamide therapy with oral anticoagulants? A) Increased action of the anticoagulant B) Increased risk of anaphylactic shock C) Rendering of sulfonamide therapy ineffective D) Development of leukopenia Answer: A Rationale: Taking sulfonamide drugs when the client is already taking oral anticoagulants may result in increased action of the anticoagulants. Anaphylactic shock and leukopenia are some of the adverse reactions of sulfonamides but are not associated with mixing sulfonamides and anticoagulants. Oral anticoagulants do not decrease the effectiveness of sulfonamides.

A client who is on sulfonamide therapy is about to be discharged. Which precaution should the nurse instruct the client to follow to reduce the effects of photosensitivity? A) Wear protective clothing and sunscreen when outside. B) Increase fluid intake. C) Avoid lights while indoors. D) Wear protective footwear. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should encourage a client to wear protective clothing while going out in the sun to reduce the effect of photosensitivity. While increasing the fluid intake is recommended, it does not help combat the effects of photosensitivity. There is no need to avoid lights while indoors; the skin becomes sensitive only to harsh sunlight during sulfonamide therapy. Wearing protective footwear may protect the feet from injury, but it will not protect all the skin from the harmful effects of photosensitivity.

A 60-year-old client with altered urinary elimination is prescribed sulfonamide and instructed to increase daily fluid intake. Which nursing intervention would be most appropriate to address the fear of incontinence? A) Inform the client that there is no need to increase fluid intake. B) Inform the client that increasing fluid intake will not result in incontinence. C) Teach the client the times to take fluids to maintain continence. D) Increase fluid intake by 1000 mL instead of 2000 mL to avoid incontinence. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse's responsibility is to help the client overcome the fear of incontinence and to teach the client when to take fluids to maintain continence. Instead of telling the client that increasing fluid intake has no effect on continence, the nurse should focus on helping the client with the problems of incontinence. The nurse should instruct the client to increase the fluid intake by at least 2000 mL, instead of only 1000 mL; however, this will not help control incontinence.

A nurse is caring for a client who is being administered sulfasalazine. Which instruction should the nurse include to ensure that the client gets the full benefits of the treatment? A) Take dosage while eating or immediately after eating. B) Increase food intake for the duration of sulfonamide therapy. C) Take the drug with a full glass of milk instead of water. D) Drink at least two to three 8-ounce glasses of fluid every day. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should administer sulfasalazine with food or immediately afterward. Increasing the food intake during sulfonamide therapy is not necessary, as long as a proper diet is maintained and the health care provider's recommendations are followed. Two to three 8-ounce glasses of fluid is not enough; the client should drink at least eight to ten 8-ounce glasses of fluid every day. All drugs should be taken with water and not milk, juice, or any other liquid, unless specifically instructed by the health care provider.

A client who is being discharged has been instructed to continue with sulfonamide therapy for a week. Which point should the nurse include in the teaching plan to educate the client about the therapy? A) Discontinue dosage if symptoms of infection disappear. B) Take the drug a few minutes before a meal. C) Take any off-the-shelf medication if fever occurs. D) Ensure that all follow-up appointments are met. Answer: D Rationale: The nurse's plan should include educating the client about the importance of keeping the follow-up appointments. The nurse should instruct the client to adhere to the dosage schedule and not discontinue it even if the symptoms of the infection have gone. The client should inform the primary health care provider if fever, skin rash, or nausea occurs during the therapy. The client should be instructed to take the drug on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before or after a meal) and not just before a meal.

A nurse caring for a client with burns carefully applies the topical silver sulfadiazine. The nurse would be alert for which potential adverse reaction? A) Facial edema B) Skin necrosis C) Headache D) Rash Answer: B Rationale: Skin necrosis is an adverse effect of silver sulfadiazine that the nurse should be alert for. Facial edema and rash are adverse effects of mafenide, used for second- and third-degree burns. Headache is an adverse effect of sulfadiazine, used for urinary tract infection.

After teaching a group of nursing students about the action of sulfonamides, the instructor determines that the teaching was successful when the students articulate that this class of drugs has primarily what action? A) Bacteriostatic B) Bactericidal C) Promotor of folic acid activity D) Bacterial cell metabolizer Answer: A Rationale: The sulfonamides are primarily bacteriostatic because of their ability to inhibit the activity of folic acid in bacterial cell metabolism. They are not bactericidal.

When developing the plan of care for a client receiving sulfonamides for treatment of a urinary tract infection, the nurse determines actions for encouraging fluid intake and monitoring intake and output based on which nursing diagnosis? A) Risk for Fluid Imbalance B) Altered Urinary Elimination C) Risk for Ineffective Renal Perfusion D) Stress Incontinence Answer: B Rationale: A client with a urinary tract infection already is experiencing an alteration in urinary elimination. Because one adverse effect of the sulfonamide drugs is altered elimination patterns, it is important to help the client maintain adequate fluid intake and output. The nurse would encourage clients to increase fluid intake to 2000 mL or more per day to prevent crystalluria and stones (calculi) forming in the genitourinary tract, as well as to aid in removing microorganisms from the urinary tract. It is important to measure and record the client's intake and output every 8 hours and notify the primary health care provider if the urinary output decreases or the client fails to increase their oral intake. If the client is unable to maintain adequate intake, then they would be at risk for fluid imbalance. If renal injury would occur, then the client would be at risk for ineffective renal perfusion. Bladder training would be an appropriate intervention to address stress incontinence.

After teaching the client about taking the prescribed sulfonamide therapy, the nurse determines that the client needs additional teaching after they make which comment? A) “I should take the drug with a large glass of water each time.” B) “I can take the drug at different times of the day each day.” C) “I have to finish the full prescription for the medication.” D) “I should call my doctor if my symptoms seem to get worse.” Answer: B Rationale: It is important that the client takes the drug at the scheduled intervals consistently throughout the course of the therapy because a certain amount of the drug must be in the body at all times for the infection to be controlled. The client is correct in taking the drug with a large glass of water each time, finishing the full prescription, and calling the doctor if symptoms get worse. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 6 Learning Objective: 5 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 74, Taking Anti-Infectives 16. A client develops a cough and fever and laboratory test results reveal leukopenia after receiving sulfonamide therapy. When developing the client's plan of care, the nurse would determine which nursing diagnosis is most appropriate? A) Altered Urinary Elimination B) Altered Skin Integrity C) Infection (Secondary) Risk D) Deficient Knowledge Answer: C Rationale: Fever and leukopenia suggest an infection, which can occur secondarily with sulfonamide therapy. Therefore, Infection (Secondary) Risk would be the most appropriate nursing diagnosis. Altered Urinary Elimination would be appropriate if the client was experiencing changes in urinary output. Altered Skin Integrity would be appropriate if the client developed a rash or hypersensitivity reaction. Deficient Knowledge would be appropriate if the client lacked understanding of the drug therapy, which is not evident in this situation. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 6 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 72, Nursing Diagnoses 17. A client asks the nurse why fluid intake should be increased while taking sulfonamides. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “The fluids will help to decrease your risk for kidney stones.” B) “You need fluids so that you won't develop a reaction in the sunlight.” C) “Fluids prevent you from getting dehydrated.” D) “You need fluids to keep your blood count from dropping too low.” Answer: A Rationale: With sulfonamides, the client is at risk for crystalluria and kidney stones. Increasing fluid intake helps to reduce the risk for their development. Fluids will have no effect on the development of photosensitivity or maintaining blood counts. Although fluids help to minimize the risk for dehydration, this is not the reason for increasing fluid intake with sulfonamide therapy.

A nurse is preparing a plan of care for an older client who is receiving sulfonamide therapy. Which would the nurse include in the plan of care to reduce the likelihood of causing renal damage? Select all that apply. A) Administer sulfonamides once daily. B) Increase fluid intake up to 2000 mL if tolerated. C) Use sulfonamides cautiously in clients with renal impairment. D) Administer the dose intravenously instead of orally. E) Ask the prescriber to change the medication ordered. Answer: B, C Rationale: Older adults experience a decline in renal function with aging. Therefore, sulfonamides must be used cautiously in older clients. In addition, increasing fluid intake up to 2000 mL daily can decrease the likelihood of causing renal damage in older clients. The drug is administered throughout the day, not as a once-daily dose. Sulfonamides can affect renal function regardless of the route administered. Asking the prescriber to change the medication ordered may be appropriate but is not necessary as long as the drug is administered cautiously and the client is monitored closely.
