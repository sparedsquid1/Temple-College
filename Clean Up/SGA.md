"SGA" can stand for several things depending on the context, but in medical and pharmaceutical contexts, it most commonly refers to **Second-Generation [[Antipsychotics]]** (SGAs). These are a class of medications primarily used to treat psychiatric conditions like [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], and sometimes [[major depressive disorder]].

### Second-Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs)
SGAs are also known as atypical [[Antipsychotics]], and they differ from first-generation [[Antipsychotics]] in their chemical structure, mechanism of action, and side effect profiles.

### Common SGAs
- **[[risperidone]] (Risperdal)**
- **[[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa)**
- **[[quetiapine]] (Seroquel)**
- **[[Aripiprazole]] (Abilify)**
- **[[clozapine]] (Clozaril)**
- **[[ziprasidone]] (Geodon)**
- **[[lurasidone]] (Latuda)**
- **[[paliperidone]] (Invega)**

### Interactions
SGAs primarily work by affecting neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly [[Dopamine]] and serotonin. They block [[Dopamine]] D2 receptors, which helps reduce symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions. SGAs also have effects on serotonin receptors, which is thought to contribute to their effectiveness in treating mood symptoms and reducing certain side effects associated with first-generation [[Antipsychotics]].

### Benefits Over First-Generation Antipsychotics
- **Lower Risk of Extrapyramidal Symptoms ([[EPS]])**: These are movement-related side effects, such as tremors, rigidity, and [[Tardive Dyskinesia]], which are more common with first-generation [[Antipsychotics]].
- **Better Tolerability**: SGAs are generally better tolerated, particularly in terms of reducing [[negative symptoms]] of [[schizophrenia]] and cognitive impairment.
- **Mood Stabilization**: SGAs are also used in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]] due to their mood-stabilizing properties.

### Potential Side Effects
While SGAs have a lower risk of causing [[EPS]], they can still cause other side effects, such as:
- **Weight Gain**: Particularly with medications like [[Olanzapine]] and [[clozapine]].
- **Metabolic Syndrome**: Increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension.
- **Sedation**: Some SGAs can cause drowsiness.
- **Increased Prolactin Levels**: Leading to symptoms like breast enlargement and milk production in both men and women.

### Monitoring and Management
Patients on SGAs often require regular monitoring of their weight, [[Blood]] sugar, and lipid levels to manage the risk of metabolic side effects. Adjustments in diet, exercise, and sometimes medication are necessary to mitigate these risks.
