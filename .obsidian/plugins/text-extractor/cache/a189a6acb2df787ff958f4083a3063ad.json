In your own words, describe the firmness and texture of the sheep brain tissue as observed when cutting into it. Because formalin hardens all tissue, what conclusions might you draw about the firmness and texture of living brain tissue? 18. When comparing human and sheep brains, you observe some profound differences between them. Record your observations in the chart below.

Spinal Nerves and Nerve Plexuses 10. In the human, there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, named according to the region of the vertebral column from which they is- sue. The spinal nerves are named below. Indicate how they are numbered. cervical nerves sacral nerves lumbar nerves thoracic nerves 11. The ventral rami of spinal nerves C1 through T1 and T12 through S4 take part in forming , which serve the of the body. The ventral rami of T2 through T12 run between the ribs to serve the . The dorsal rami of the spinal nerves serve . 12. What would happen if the following structures were damaged or transected? (Use the key choices for responses.) Key: a. loss of motor function b. loss of sensory function c. loss of both motor and sensory function 1. dorsal root of a spinal nerve 3. ventral ramus of a spinal nerve 2. ventral root of a spinal nerve 13. Define plexus. 14. Name the major nerves that serve the following body areas. 1. head, neck, shoulders (name plexus only) 2. diaphragm 3. posterior thigh 4. leg and foot (name two) 5. anterior forearm muscles (name two) 6. arm muscles (name two) 7. abdominal wall (name plexus only) 8. anterior thigh 9. medial side of the hand The Autonomic Nervous System 15. For the most part, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers serve the same organs and structures. How can they exert antag- onistic effects? (After all, nerve impulses are nerve impulses—aren’t they?) cervical phrenic sciatic common fibular, tibial, sural, medial and lateral plantar median, ulnar radial, musculocutaneous lumbar femoral ulnar C1 – C8 S1 – S5 L1 – L5 T1 – T12 plexuses limbs and anterior trunk intercostal muscles the posterior body trunk bc a A complex network of joining and diverging nerves. They release different neurotransmitters, which bind to different receptors. The last pair of spinal nerves is the pair of coccygeal nerves. Label how the rest of the spinal nerves are numbered.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
