[[Addison's disease]], also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is a rare but serious disorder in which the adrenal glands, located on top of the kidneys, do not produce enough of certain [[Hormones]]. The adrenal glands produce vital [[Hormones]] such as [[cortisol]] and aldosterone, which are essential for regulating metabolism, [[Blood]] pressure, and the bodyâ€™s response to stress.

### Causes:
- **Autoimmune Response:** The most common cause of [[Addison's disease]] is an autoimmune reaction, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands that produces [[cortisol]] and aldosterone.
- **Infections:** Certain infections, such as tuberculosis, HIV, or fungal infections, can damage the adrenal glands.
- **Other Causes:** Less commonly, [[Addison's disease]] may result from genetic mutations, cancer spreading to the adrenal glands, or bleeding into the adrenal glands.

### Symptoms:
Symptoms of [[Addison's disease]] often develop gradually and may be mistaken for other conditions. They may become apparent during times of physical stress, such as illness or injury.

- **Fatigue and Weakness:** Persistent tiredness and muscle weakness are common.
- **Weight Loss and Decreased Appetite:** Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite.
- **Low [[Blood]] Pressure:** Often leading to dizziness or fainting.
- **Hyperpigmentation:** Darkening of the skin, particularly in areas exposed to the sun, and in creases like the palms, elbows, knees, and scars. This is due to increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which is associated with the increased production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) in response to low [[cortisol]] levels.
- **Salt Cravings:** Due to low levels of aldosterone, which affects sodium balance.
- **Low [[Blood]] Sugar (Hypoglycemia):** Especially common in children.
- **Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea:** [[Digestive]] issues are common.
- **Abdominal Pain:** Sometimes associated with vomiting.
- **Irritability and [[Depression]]:** Mood changes can occur.

### Addisonian Crisis:
An Addisonian crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency, is a life-threatening condition that can occur if [[Addison's disease]] is untreated or if the body is under severe stress (like surgery, injury, or infection). Symptoms include:
- **Severe Weakness**
- **Confusion**
- **Severe Abdominal Pain**
- **Low [[Blood]] Pressure (leading to shock)**
- **Severe Vomiting and Diarrhea**
- **Loss of Consciousness**

This is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with intravenous fluids, salt, sugar (glucose), and [[Glucocorticoids]].

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Blood]] Tests:** To measure levels of [[cortisol]], sodium, potassium, and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).
- **ACTH Stimulation Test:** Measures how well the adrenal glands respond to ACTH, which stimulates [[cortisol]] production.
- **Imaging Tests:** CT or MRI scans may be used to assess the size and shape of the adrenal glands.

### Treatment:
Treatment for [[Addison's disease]] involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy to correct the levels of [[Hormones]] the adrenal glands are not producing:
- **[[Corticosteroids]]:** Oral [[Glucocorticoids]] like hydrocortisone or [[prednisone]] to replace [[cortisol]].
- **[[Mineralocorticoids]]:** [[fludrocortisone]] to replace aldosterone and help maintain sodium and potassium balance.
- **Salt Intake:** Some individuals may need to increase their salt intake, especially during hot weather or intense exercise.
- **Emergency Precautions:** People with [[Addison's disease]] are often advised to carry an emergency injection of corticosteroid (like hydrocortisone) and wear a medical alert bracelet in case of an Addisonian crisis.

### Prognosis:
With appropriate treatment, individuals with [[Addison's disease]] can lead normal, healthy lives. However, it requires lifelong management, including regular monitoring and adjustments to medication during times of stress, illness, or surgery.
