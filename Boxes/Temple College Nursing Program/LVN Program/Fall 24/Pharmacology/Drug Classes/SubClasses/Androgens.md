### Adverse Reactions 
Androgens In men, administration of androgen may result in breast enlargement (gynecomastia), testicular atrophy, and inhibition of testicular function, impotence, enlargement of the penis, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, headache, [[anxiety]], male-pattern baldness, acne, and [[Depression]]. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which include sodium, water, chloride, potassium, calcium, and phosphate retention, may also occur. 

In women receiving an androgen preparation for breast [[Carcinoma]], the most common adverse reactions are amenorrhea, menstrual irregularities, and virilization (acquisition of male sexual characteristics by a woman). Virilization produces facial hair, a deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris. Male-pattern baldness and acne may also result. 

**Anabolic Steroids** 
Virilization in a woman is the most common reaction associated with anabolic steroids, especially when higher doses are used. Acne occurs frequently in [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] age groups and both sexes. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte imbalances (the same as for the androgens, discussed previously), testicular atrophy, jaundice, anorexia, and muscle cramps may also be seen. [[Blood]]-filled cysts of the [[Liver]] and sometimes the spleen, malignant and benign [[Liver]] tumors, an increased risk of [[Atherosclerosis]], and mental changes are the most serious adverse reactions that may occur during prolonged use. 

Many serious adverse drug reactions are being reported in healthy individuals using anabolic steroids. There is some indication that prolonged high-dose use has resulted in psychological and possibly physical dependence and some individuals have required treatment in drug rehabilitation centers. Severe mental changes, such as uncontrolled rage (called “roid rage”), severe [[Depression]], and suicidal tendencies; malignant and benign [[Liver]] tumors; aggressive behavior; increased risk of [[Atherosclerosis]]; inability to concentrate; and [[personality]] changes are not uncommon. In addition, the incidence of the severe adverse reactions cited earlier appears to be increased in those using anabolic steroids for this purpose.

### Contraindications
The male [[Hormones]] are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], [[Liver]] disorders, or serious cardiac disease, and in men with prostate gland disorders (e.g., prostate [[Carcinoma]] and prostate enlargement). These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are classified as [[Preg Cat X]] [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation. Anabolic steroids are contraindicated for use to enhance physical appearance or athletic performance. Anabolic steroids should be used cautiously in older men because of increased risk of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.
