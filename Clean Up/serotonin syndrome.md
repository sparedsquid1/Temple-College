Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when there is an excess of serotonin in the brain. This can happen when someone takes medications that increase serotonin levels, either in excessive doses or in combination with other [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that affect serotonin.

### Causes
Serotonin syndrome is most commonly triggered by the use of certain medications or drug combinations, including:
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: e.g., [[Fluoxetine]], [[sertraline]].
- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: e.g., [[venlafaxine]], [[Duloxetine]].
- **[[Monoamine]] oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: e.g., [[phenelzine]], [[selegiline]].
- **[[Tricyclic Antidepressants]] (TCAs)**: e.g., [[amitriptyline]].
- **Certain pain medications**: e.g., [[tramadol]].
- **Recreational [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]**: e.g., MDMA (ecstasy), LSD.
- **Over-the-counter supplements**: e.g., St. Johnâ€™s Wort, tryptophan.

### Symptoms
The symptoms of serotonin syndrome can range from mild to severe and may include:
- **Cognitive/behavioral**: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations.
- **Autonomic**: Hyperthermia, sweating, shivering, high [[Blood]] pressure, rapid [[Heart]] rate.
- **Neuromuscular**: Tremors, muscle rigidity, clonus (involuntary muscle contractions), hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes).
- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

### Diagnosis
There is no specific test for serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis is primarily based on the patient's history, symptoms, and a physical examination. The Hunter Criteria is often used, which includes symptoms like spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus, or agitation in combination with hyperreflexia, among others.

### Treatment
- **Immediate discontinuation of serotonergic medications**.
- **Supportive care**: Monitoring vital signs, hydration, and cooling measures.
- **Medications**: [[Benzodiazepines]] for agitation or tremors, cyproheptadine (a serotonin antagonist) in severe cases.
- **Hospitalization**: Required for severe cases, particularly where there is a risk of complications like seizures or severe hyperthermia.

### Prevention
- **Avoid combining serotonergic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] without medical supervision**.
- **Inform your healthcare provider of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] medications and supplements you are taking**.
- **Use the lowest effective dose of serotonergic medications**.

Serotonin syndrome can develop rapidly, often within hours of taking the offending drug or increasing the dose, so prompt recognition and treatment are crucial.
