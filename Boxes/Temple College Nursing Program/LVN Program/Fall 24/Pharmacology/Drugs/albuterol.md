### Mechanisms of Action
#### Albuterol: Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Nursing Considerations

**Mechanism of Action (MOA):**

- **Albuterol** is a **beta-2 [[Adrenergic]] agonist**.
- It selectively stimulates **beta-2 [[Adrenergic]] receptors** in the **bronchiolar smooth muscle**, causing **bronchodilation**.
- This results in the relaxation of smooth muscles in the airways, improving airflow and alleviating symptoms of bronchospasm, such as wheezing and shortness of breath.
- It is used in the treatment of **asthma**, **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, and other conditions involving bronchospasm.

**Nursing Considerations:**

1. **Assess [[Respiratory]] Status:**
    
    - Monitor **[[Respiratory]] rate**, **oxygen saturation**, and **lung sounds** before and after administration.
    - Assess for improvement in symptoms (e.g., decreased wheezing and increased ease of breathing).
2. **Inhaler Technique:**
    
    - Ensure proper **inhaler technique** if using metered-dose inhalers (MDI) or nebulizers. Incorrect use can reduce the effectiveness of the drug.
3. **Monitoring for Side Effects:**
    
    - **Tachycardia**: Monitor [[Heart]] rate, as albuterol can cause increased [[Heart]] rate.
    - **Tremors**: A common side effect, especially in higher doses.
    - **Palpitations**: Report any irregular heartbeats or palpitations.
    - **Nervousness or restlessness**: Monitor for any unusual behavior or [[anxiety]].
4. **Risk of Overuse:**
    
    - Overuse of albuterol can lead to **beta-receptor desensitization**, reducing the drug’s effectiveness and causing rebound bronchoconstriction.
    - Advise patients not to exceed the prescribed dose and to seek medical help if symptoms worsen.
5. **Interactions:**
    
    - Be cautious when administering with other **sympathomimetic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]** (e.g., [[Epinephrine]]) or **beta-blockers**, as interactions may affect effectiveness or exacerbate side effects.
    - **[[Diuretics]]** may enhance albuterol’s tendency to cause **hypokalemia** (low potassium levels).
6. **Patient Education:**
    
    - Instruct patients on proper use of inhalers and nebulizers.
    - Explain the importance of using a **controller medication** (e.g., [[Inhaled Corticosteroids]]) in conjunction with albuterol for long-term asthma management.
    - Educate patients about the potential for side effects, such as shaking hands or feeling jittery, and to report if symptoms persist or worsen.
7. **Pregnancy Category:**
    
    - **Category C**: Use cautiously during pregnancy and only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
8. **Monitoring in Special Populations:**
    
    - Use with caution in patients with **cardiac issues**, **hypertension**, or **diabetes**.
    - Adjust the dose and monitor closely in **elderly patients**, as they may be more sensitive to side effects.
