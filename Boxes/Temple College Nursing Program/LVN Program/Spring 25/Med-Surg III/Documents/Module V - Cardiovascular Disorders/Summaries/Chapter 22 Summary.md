### **Summary of Chapter 22: Hypertension**

#### **Definition and Classification**

- **Hypertension** is high blood pressure and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke.
- **Normal BP:** Below **120/80 mmHg**
- **Elevated BP:** **120-129/80 mmHg**
- **Hypertension Stage 1:** **130-139/80-89 mmHg**
- **Hypertension Stage 2:** **≥140/90 mmHg**

#### **Pathophysiology**

- Blood pressure is determined by **[cardiac output](obsidian://vault/personal/sources/co) (CO)**, **peripheral vascular resistance (PVR)**, and **blood volume (BDV)**.
- **Increased CO** occurs due to physical or emotional activity.
- **Increased PVR** results from vasoconstriction or narrowed vessels.
- **Increased BDV** is due to **sodium retention** and **kidney dysfunction**.

#### **Types of Hypertension**

- **Primary (Essential) Hypertension:** No known cause; develops gradually.
- **Secondary Hypertension:** Caused by an underlying condition (e.g., kidney disease).

#### **Signs and Symptoms**

- Called the **"silent killer"** because many people are asymptomatic.
- Symptoms include **headache, nosebleeds, dizziness, visual disturbances, and edema**.
- **Target organ damage** affects the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes.

#### **Risk Factors**

**Nonmodifiable:**
- **Family history, age, diabetes, ethnicity (higher in African Americans)**
**Modifiable:**
- **High sodium intake, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, alcohol, stress, lack of sleep**
 
#### **Diagnosis**

- **BP measured on two or more different occasions, showing >139/89 mmHg**.
- **Tests:** ECG, blood glucose, cholesterol, electrolyte levels.

#### **Treatment and Management**

**Lifestyle Changes:**
- **Reduce sodium intake (≤1500 mg/day)**
- **Healthy diet, weight loss, exercise (30 min/day)**
- **Quit smoking, reduce alcohol, manage stress**

**Medications:**
1. **Diuretics** (e.g., **Hydrochlorothiazide, Furosemide**): Increase urine output, reduce sodium and water.
2. **Beta-blockers** (e.g., **Metoprolol, Atenolol**): Lower heart rate and BP.
3. **ACE inhibitors** (e.g., **Lisinopril, Enalapril**): Prevent vasoconstriction.
4. **Calcium channel blockers** (e.g., **Amlodipine, Diltiazem**): Vasodilation.
5. **ARBs**(Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) (e.g., **Losartan, Candesartan**): Block angiotensin receptors.
6. **Direct vasodilators** (e.g., **Hydralazine**): Relax blood vessels.

#### **Hypertensive Crisis**

- **Urgency:** High BP without organ damage; may cause headache, anxiety.
- **Emergency:** BP >180/120 mmHg; risk of heart attack, stroke, organ failure. **Treated with IV medications (Nitroprusside)**.

#### **Nursing Interventions**

- **Monitor BP, weight, edema, and medication adherence**.
- **Educate patients on lifestyle changes and medication side effects**.
- **Prevent falls (orthostatic hypotension risks with meds)**.
- **Encourage diet modifications and exercise**.

---

#### **6. A patient taking Metoprolol should be instructed to:**

A) Stop taking the medication if they feel dizzy  
B) Rise slowly from sitting to standing ✅  
C) Expect an increased heart rate  
D) Take it on an empty stomach

**Rationale:** **Beta-blockers** can cause **orthostatic hypotension**, so patients should rise slowly to prevent dizziness.

---

#### **7. Which patient is most at risk for hypertension?**

A) A 30-year-old athlete
