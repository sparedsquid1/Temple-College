A nurse suspects that a client receiving oral penicillin therapy is developing pseudomembranous colitis based on which assessment finding? A) Bloody diarrhea B) Pruritus C) Chills D) Hives Answer: A Rationale: Pseudomembranous colitis is a severe, life-threatening form of diarrhea that occurs when normal flora of the bowel is eliminated and replaced with C. difficile (C. diff) bacteria. It is manifested by bloody diarrhea. Pruritus and hives would suggest an allergic reaction. Chills could indicate a wide range of problems.

After completing several days of penicillin therapy, a client presents with new reports of inflamed oral mucous membranes and tongue and gum swelling. What is a priority action in regards to this new finding? A) Inspect mouth and gums regularly. B) Instruct client to avoid brushing teeth. C) Offer client a liquid diet. D) Instruct the client to gargle every 2 hours. Answer: A Rationale: The client is presenting with signs of a fungal superinfection. The nurse should regularly inspect the client's mouth and gums to assess the client's progress. The nurse should instruct the client to use a soft-bristled toothbrush. The client does not need to follow a liquid diet; a nonirritating soft diet can be recommended. Gargling every 2 hours may not help relieve the symptoms and may even aggravate the existing condition.

Before administering the first dose of a penicillin to the client, which assessment should the nurse perform as part of the preadministration assessment? A) Review of renal and hepatic function tests B) Inspection of client's stools C) Evaluation of client's lifestyle and diet D) General history of client's health Answer: D Rationale: Before administering the first dose of penicillin, the nurse should obtain and review the client's general health history, including any allergy history, a history of all medical and surgical treatments, a drug history, and the current symptoms of the infection. The client's stool is examined only after penicillin has been administered if the client has diarrhea. It is not required to evaluate the client's lifestyle and diet as part of the preadministration assessment for the first dose. Renal and hepatic function tests may be performed at intervals during penicillin therapy, usually not before it.

A 26-year-old female client with a skin infection has been prescribed 400 mg ampicillin to be taken orally. Which instruction should the nurse include in the client teaching plan? A) If a dosage is missed, increase the next dosage to meet the daily quota. B) Ampicillin will reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. C) Take drug on an empty stomach, an hour before or 2 hours after meals. D) Avoid use of skin care products, like moisturizers, when on penicillin therapy. Answer: B Rationale: Ampicillin (also penicillin V) reduces the effectiveness of birth control pills. Increasing a dosage to compensate for a missed dosage should not be done. The client should adhere to the prescribed regimen as strictly as possible. Ampicillin and penicillin V may be taken without regard to meals. The client need not avoid use of skin care products when on penicillin therapy.

A client undergoing penicillin therapy shows improvement and confirms feeling better. Which intervention is the nurse most likely to perform in such a situation? A) Instruct client to increase dietary intake. B) Inform the primary health provider immediately. C) Record assessments on client's chart. D) Inquire about any previous drug allergies. Answer: C Rationale: When the client shows and verbally confirms improved health, it should be recorded on the client's chart. If the condition of the client has improved, the client will show an increased appetite, but there is no need to instruct the client to increase dietary intake. The primary health provider need not be informed about the condition immediately unless the client shows signs of deterioration or complications. The nurse should inquire about previous drug allergies before the start of therapy.

After taking penicillin as prescribed, a client shows signs of diarrhea and informs the nurse that there is blood in the stools. Which intervention should the nurse do next? A) Contact primary health provider immediately. B) Have the client consume yogurt with the next meal. C) Decrease fiber content in diet. D) Continue with prescribed regimen. Answer: A Rationale: If diarrhea is suspected, the nurse should notify the primary health care provider immediately. The nurse should wait for the primary health care provider's instructions before continuing with the prescribed regimen. Yogurt or buttermilk may help prevent fungal superinfections, but they will not help alleviate the client's condition at this stage. Changes in the diet are not recommended unless instructed by the primary health care provider.

A nurse is caring for a client who is receiving penicillin. The nurse would assess for which common adverse reaction? A) Inflammation of the tongue and mouth B) Altered oral mucous membranes C) Severe hypotension D) Sudden loss of consciousness Answer: A Rationale: Some of the common adverse effects of penicillin are glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth), and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach). Unless the adverse effects are severe, the drug may be continued as prescribed and the nurse would intervene to help the client manage the common adverse reactions. Altered oral mucous membranes would suggest a possible fungal superinfection in the oral cavity, whereas severe hypotension and sudden loss of consciousness are signs of anaphylactic shock; these are not common adverse effects of penicillin and require immediate medical attention.

A nurse is required to administer a parenteral form of penicillin to a client. Which intervention would be most appropriate for the nurse to do when preparing penicillin in parenteral form? A) Extract penicillin from vial and then reconstitute. B) Save excess antibiotic after reconstitution for later use. C) Use any available diluent for reconstitution. D) Shake the vial well to distribute the drug evenly. Answer: D Rationale: When preparing a parenteral form of penicillin, the nurse should shake the vial thoroughly before withdrawing the drug to ensure its even distribution in the solution. Penicillins in powder or crystalline form must be reconstituted before being withdrawn from the vial. Excess antibiotic after reconstitution should never be saved, as the drug loses its potency when stored. Reconstitution should be done only with the diluent prescribed on the manufacturer's label.

While obtaining a medication history on a 48-year-old client who is to receive penicillin for an ear infection, the nurse learns the client takes a beta-adrenergic blocker for hypertension. The nurse develops appropriate nursing goals as this client is at increased risk for which adverse reaction if penicillin is administered? A) Anaphylactic shock B) Higher blood pressure C) Excess bleeding D) Heart attack Answer: A Rationale: Combining penicillins with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs increases the risk of anaphylactic shock. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are used to control blood pressure and heart problems, but combining them with penicillins does not increase the risk of high blood pressure or heart attack. Risk of bleeding is maximized if penicillins are combined with anticoagulants.

A 75-year-old client with a history of renal impairment is admitted with a UTI and has been prescribed a cephalosporin. Which intervention is most important for the nurse to perform when caring for this client? A) Monitoring fluid intake B) Monitoring blood creatinine levels C) Testing for occult blood D) Testing for increased glucose levels Answer: B Rationale: An elderly client is more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of the cephalosporins. Since renal impairment is present, it is important for the nurse to closely monitor the client's blood creatinine levels. The nurse should conduct a test for occult blood if blood and mucus occur in the stool and monitor the fluid intake if there is a decrease in urine output. The nurse does not need to monitor for increased glucose levels unless the client has a history of diabetes. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 7 Learning Objective: 5 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 87, Lifespan Considerations 11. The nurse administers cefuroxime to a client at least 1 hour before meals, as prescribed; however, the client experiences GI upset. Which action would be most appropriate for the nurse to do? A) Administer an antacid. B) Lower the dosage. C) Discontinue the drug. D) Administer the drug with food. Answer: D Rationale: If the client experiences GI upset, the nurse can administer cefuroxime with food. A decrease in the dosage is suggested in a client with renal impairment. A change in dosage, discontinuation of the drug, or use of an antacid is recommended only if prescribed by the health care provider. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 7 Learning Objective: 5 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 86, Oral Administration 12. A nurse needs to administer a cephalosporin to a client. The client informs the nurse that he is allergic to penicillin. Which action by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) Inform the primary health care provider. B) Obtain the client's occupational history. C) Administer an antipyretic drug. D) Obtain specimens for kidney function tests. Answer: A Rationale: Clients with a history of an allergy to penicillin may also be allergic to cephalosporin, so the nurse needs to inform the primary health care provider before the first dose of the drug is given. An antipyretic drug is administered when there is an increase in the body temperature of a client receiving cephalosporin. Liver and kidney function tests may be ordered by the primary health care provider, not the nurse. Occupational history should be obtained before administration of any drug, irrespective of the client's allergies. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 7 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 82, Cephalosporins 13. A nurse is conducting an in-service about antibacterial drugs such as penicillins and cephalosporins. During the question-and-answer period, the audience asks for examples of conditions that can be treated by cephalosporins. Which examples would the nurse include in the response? A) Hemolysis B) Urinary tract infections C) Nausea and diarrhea D) Jaundice Answer: B Rationale: Cephalosporins are used to treat respiratory infections, otitis media, urinary tract infections, and bone and joint infections, and prophylactically to treat infections that may result from a sexual assault. Cephalosporins are not used to treat hemolysis or jaundice. Nausea and diarrhea are some of the adverse reactions that can occur when a client is on cephalosporin therapy. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 7 Learning Objective: 1 Cognitive Level: Understand Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 82, Cephalosporins 14. The nurse is providing care to a client who is receiving an aminoglycoside and cephalosporin. Which assessment is a priority of care? A) Nausea B) Nephrotoxicity C) Increased bleeding D) Respiratory difficulty Answer: B Rationale: When cephalosporin is administered with aminoglycosides, it increases the risk for nephrotoxicity and should be closely monitored. Nausea is an adverse reaction of cephalosporins in clients with gastrointestinal tract infection. The risk of bleeding increases when cephalosporin is administered with oral anticoagulants. The risk for respiratory difficulty and a disulfiram-like reaction increases if alcohol is consumed within 72 hours after administration of certain cephalosporins.

While the nurse is obtaining a drug history from a client, the client states an allergy to penicillin and an experience of a rash after taking cephalosporin. The nurse interprets this information as indicating which situation? A) Hypersensitivity B) Cross-sensitivity C) Anaphylactoid reaction D) Anaphylaxis Answer: B Rationale: Once an individual is allergic to one penicillin, they are usually allergic to all of the penicillins. Those allergic to penicillin also have a higher incidence of allergy to the cephalosporins. Allergy to drugs in the same or related groups is called cross-sensitivity. Hypersensitivity is an allergic reaction to one substance. Anaphylactoid reaction is an unusual or exaggerated allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock is a severe form of hypersensitivity that occurs immediately and can be fatal.

A client receiving penicillin therapy reports mouth irritation and a sore throat to the nurse. Inspection reveals a red, swollen tongue with ulcerations. The nurse suspects a fungal superinfection and prioritizes which nursing diagnosis as most appropriate for this client? A) Altered Comfort B) Altered Oral Mucous Membranes C) Deficient Knowledge D) Inadequate Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements Answer: B Rationale: The assessment suggests a fungal superinfection, which would lead to the nursing diagnosis of Altered Oral Mucous Membranes. Although Altered Comfort may be appropriate, Altered Oral Mucous Membranes is more specific. There is no evidence of lack of knowledge or problems with nutrition. However, if the superinfection is not addressed, the client may experience difficulty eating due to the irritation and discomfort.
