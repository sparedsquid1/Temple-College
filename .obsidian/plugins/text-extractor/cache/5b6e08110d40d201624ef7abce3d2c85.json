A nurse is teaching a client about acarbose. The nurse determines the teaching is successful when the client correctly states which instruction to follow when administering the drug at home? A) Administer the drug with breakfast. B) Expect to add an oral sulfonylurea with the drug. C) Administer the drug with the first bite of the meal. D) Report unusual somnolence to the primary health care provider. Answer: C Rationale: Acarbose should be administered with the first bite of the meal. Glyburide needs to be administered with breakfast. An oral sulfonylurea will likely be added to metformin if the client does not experience a response in 4 weeks using the maximum dose of metformin. Clients taking metformin may experience unusual somnolence, of which the nurse should inform the primary health care provider.

The nurse has administered glipizide and warfarin to a client. Which finding on assessment should the nurse prioritize? A) Increased risk of lactic acidosis B) Risk of acute renal failure C) Increased risk for bleeding D) Increased hypoglycemic effect Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should observe for increased hypoglycemic effect in the client as the effect of the interaction of sulfonylureas (glipizide) with the anticoagulants (warfarin), chloramphenicol, clofibrate, fluconazole, histamine-2 antagonists, methyldopa, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), salicylates, sulfonamides, and tricyclic antidepressants. Increased risk of lactic acidosis is an effect of the interaction of metformin with glucocorticoids. Increased risk for bleeding is an effect of the interaction of oral anticoagulants with anti-infective drugs. There is a risk of acute renal failure when iodinated contrast material used for radiologic studies is administered with metformin.

A nurse is preparing to administer insulin glargine to a client. What precaution should the nurse take when administering this drug? A) Administer glargine via IV route. B) Avoid mixing glargine with other insulins. C) Shake the vial vigorously before withdrawing insulin. D) Be sure the insulin has been refrigerated. Answer: B Rationale: When administering insulin glargine to the client, the nurse should avoid mixing it with other insulins or solutions. It will precipitate in the syringe when mixed. If glargine is mixed with another solution, it will lose glucose control, resulting in decreased effectiveness of the insulin. Glargine is administered via the subcutaneous route once daily at bedtime. The nurse should not shake the vial vigorously before withdrawing insulin. The vial should be gently rotated between the palms of the hands and tilted gently end to end immediately before withdrawing the insulin. The nurse administers insulin from vials at room temperature. Vials are stored in the refrigerator if they are to be stored for about 3 months for later use.

A nurse is preparing to administer insulin to the client. Which interventions should the nurse perform before administering each insulin dose? A) Inspect the previous injection site for inflammation. B) Keep prefilled syringes horizontally. C) Check for symptoms of myalgia or malaise. D) Mix the insulin with sterile water in the syringe. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should check the previous injection site before administering each insulin dose. The injection sites should be rotated to prevent lipodystrophy. Prefilled syringes should not be kept horizontally; they should be kept in a vertical or oblique position to avoid plugging the needle. The nurse checks for symptoms of myalgia or malaise when administration of metformin leads to lactic acidosis. Insulin should not be mixed with other drugs in the syringe. Some types of insulin may be combined in one syringe, but sterile water is never used.

A nursing instructor is teaching a group of nursing students about type 2 diabetes. The instructor determines the session is successful when the students correctly choose which as a risk factor for individuals developing type 2 diabetes? A) Young age B) Regular exercise C) Obesity D) Polyuria Answer: C Rationale: The nurse informs the client that obesity is a risk factor associated with type 2 diabetes. Older, not younger age and minimal or no physical activity, not regular exercise are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Polyuria is a symptom of diabetes and not a risk factor leading to type 2 diabetes.

The nurse is assessing a client who was administered metformin and notes hyperventilation, nausea, and somnolence. The nurse determines which nursing diagnosis should be prioritized for this client? A) Altered Breathing Pattern B) Risk for Fluid Volume Deficit C) Acute Confusion D) Anxiety Answer: A Rationale: When taking metformin, the client is at risk for lactic acidosis manifested by unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, GI symptoms, or unusual somnolence. Thus, a nursing diagnosis of Altered Breathing Pattern would be most likely. There are no problems with fluid balance. Acute Confusion would be appropriate if the client was experiencing hypoglycemia. Anxiety would be appropriate for a client who is newly diagnosed with diabetes and having difficulty accepting the diagnosis. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 40 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 524, Altered Breathing Pattern 12. A nurse is conducting a teaching session for a client newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on the importance of monitoring the blood glucose. The nurse determines additional teaching is necessary after the client makes which statement? A) “I should prick the tip of my finger to get the blood.” B) “I should clean my finger with warm, soapy water.” C) “I should massage my finger to get a hanging drop of blood.” D) “I should avoid smearing the blood on the test strip.” Answer: A Rationale: The client should insert the lancet to prick the side of the finger, not the tip, because the side has more capillaries and fewer nerve endings. The finger should be washed with warm, soapy water and then dried before testing. The client should massage the finger to get a hanging drop of blood to be placed on the test strip. The client needs to avoid smearing the blood on the strip to prevent inaccurate readings.
