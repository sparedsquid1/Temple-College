Antifungal drugs are contraindicated in clients with a history of allergy to the drug. Most of the systemic antifungal medications are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and are used only when the situation is life-threatening and outweighs the risk to the fetus. Griseofulvin is not recommended for those with severe liver disease. Voriconazole is contraindicated when clients are taking the following medications: terfenadine, astemizole, sirolimus, rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, ritonavir, ergot alkaloids, or long-acting barbiturates. Both voriconazole and itraconazole are contraindicated in clients taking cisapride, pimozide, or quinidine. The systemic agent itraconazole should not be used to treat fungal nail infections in clients with a history of heart failure. — location: [6428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=6428) ^ref-53783

anthelmintic adverse

---
Abdominal pain and cramps, diarrhea Adverse reactions associated with the anthelmintic drugs, if they do occur, are usually mild when the drug is used in the recommended dosage. Rash is a serious adverse reaction to pyrantel, which is sold over the counter (OTC), without a prescription. As such, clients may begin self-treatment before notifying their primary health provider. Therefore, it is important to ask the client about skin reactions when use of this medication is disclosed to the provider.

antiprotozoal adverse

---
Antiprotozoal drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity. Many of the drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy (most are pregnancy category C; except metronidazole, nitazoxanide, pregnancy category B; doxycycline, pregnancy category D; miltefosine, quinine, pregnancy category X). Quinine should not be prescribed for clients with myasthenia gravis, because it may cause respiratory distress and dysphagia. In addition, its use for leg cramps is discouraged because of the hematologic reactions that may occur. Antiprotozoal drugs should be used cautiously in children, lactating clients, and those who have hepatic or renal disease or bone marrow depression. Pregnancy category B antiprotozoals should be used cautiously in clients during pregnancy and lactation (can be given during the second and third trimesters) and in clients with blood dyscrasias, seizure disorders, severe hepatic impairment (metronidazole), bowel disease (paromomycin use interferes with absorption causing ototoxicity and renal impairment), or history of alcohol dependency. Clients with a history of mental health issues should not be prescribed mefloquine. — location: [6683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=6683) ^ref-50607

Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal (GI) system reactions include: Gastric upset, heartburn, nausea, vomiting Anorexia GI bleeding Although salicylates are relatively safe when taken as recommended on the label or by the primary health care provider, their use can occasionally result in more serious reactions. Loss of blood through the GI tract may occur with salicylate use. The amount of blood lost is insignificant when a single dose is taken. However, use of these drugs over a long period, even in normal doses, can result in significant blood loss. Some individuals are allergic to aspirin and other salicylates. Allergy to salicylates may be manifested by hives, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm with asthma-like symptoms, and anaphylactoid (allergic) reactions. — location: [7200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7200) ^ref-7598

Salicylates Adverse

---
Salicylates are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because salicylates prolong bleeding time, they are contraindicated in those with bleeding disorders or tendencies. These include clients with GI bleeding (from any cause), clients with blood dyscrasias (abnormalities), and clients receiving anticoagulant or antineoplastic drugs. Salicylates are classified as pregnancy category D (aspirin) and C drugs and should be used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [7208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7208) ^ref-50965

Salicylates Contra

---
Pediatric Children or teenagers with influenza or chickenpox should not take salicylates, particularly aspirin, because their use appears to be associated with Reye syndrome (a life-threatening condition characterized by vomiting and lethargy progressing to coma). Acetaminophen is recommended for managing symptoms associated with these disorders. — location: [7213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7213) ^ref-35796

---
Adverse reactions to acetaminophen are rare when the drug is used as directed. Adverse reactions associated with acetaminophen usually occur with chronic use or when the recommended dosage is exceeded. They include the following: Skin eruptions, urticaria (hives) Hemolytic anemia Pancytopenia (a reduction in all cellular components of the blood) Hypoglycemia Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin), hepatotoxicity (damage to the liver), and hepatic failure Acute acetaminophen poisoning or toxicity can occur after a single 10- to 15-g dose of acetaminophen. Doses of 20–25 g may be fatal. With excessive doses, the liver cells undergo necrosis (die), and death can result from liver failure. The risk of liver failure increases in clients who drink alcohol habitually. Signs of acute acetaminophen toxicity include nausea, vomiting, confusion, liver tenderness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, jaundice, and acute hepatic and renal failure. — location: [7267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7267) ^ref-5963

NonSalicylates contra

---
habitual alcohol users after therapeutic dosages. The individual taking acetaminophen should avoid alcohol if taking more than an occasional dose of acetaminophen and avoid taking acetaminophen concurrently with the salicylates or the NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is classified as a pregnancy category B drug and is used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. If an analgesic is necessary, it appears safe for short-term use. The drug is used cautiously in clients with severe or recurrent pain or high or continued fever because this may indicate a serious untreated illness. If pain persists for more than 5 days or if redness or swelling is present, the primary health care provider should be consulted. — location: [7279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7279) ^ref-52727

NSAIDs Adverse 2

---
The NSAIDs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity. There is a cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, meaning if a client is allergic to one NSAID, there is an increased risk of an allergic reaction with any other NSAID. Hypersensitivity to aspirin is a contraindication for all NSAIDs. In general, NSAIDs are contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy and during lactation. Also, they are not to be used for postoperative pain following CABG surgery. Some NSAIDs are not used to treat rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis; these include ketorolac, mefenamic, and meloxicam. Celecoxib is contraindicated in clients who are allergic to sulfonamides or have a history of cardiac disease or stroke. Ibuprofen is contraindicated in those who have hypertension, peptic ulceration, or GI bleeding. Arthrotec combines diclofenac and misoprostol (abortifacient), and should not be taken by pregnant women. — location: [7728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7728) ^ref-4336

Migraine drugs adverse

---
These drugs are contraindicated in clients with a known hypersensitivity to selective serotonin agonists and should only be used when a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. 5-HT agonists should not be used in clients with ischemic heart disease (such as angina or myocardial infarction), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or uncontrolled hypertension or those clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants. These drugs should be used cautiously in clients with hepatic or renal function impairment, such as the elderly or clients requiring dialysis. Because these are pregnancy category C drugs, they should be used during pregnancy only when the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when administering them to lactating mothers. The ergot derivatives (see Summary Drug Table: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Migraine Medications) should not be used by HIV clients using protease inhibitors or clients taking macrolide antibiotics because of the risk of peripheral ischemia. — location: [7819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=7819) ^ref-41657

All opioid analgesics are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs. These drugs are contraindicated in clients with acute bronchial asthma, emphysema, or upper airway obstruction and in clients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. The drugs are also contraindicated in clients with convulsive disorders, severe renal or hepatic dysfunction, and acute ulcerative colitis. The opioid analgesics are pregnancy category C drugs (oxycodone is in pregnancy category B) and are not recommended for use during pregnancy or labor because they may prolong labor or cause respiratory depression in the neonate. The use of opioid analgesics is recommended during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential harm to the fetus. — location: [8362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=8362) ^ref-1120

Antagonists are contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to the opioid antagonists. Antagonists are used cautiously in those who are pregnant (pregnancy category B), in infants of opioid-dependent mothers, and in clients with an opioid dependency or cardiovascular disease. These drugs also are used cautiously during lactation. These drugs may produce withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are physically dependent on the opioid. Antagonists may prevent the action or intended use of opioid antidiarrheals, antitussives, and analgesics. — location: [8461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=8461) ^ref-50336

Estrogen and progestin therapy is contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs, breast cancer (except for metastatic disease), estrogen-dependent neoplasms, undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, and thromboembolic disorders. The progestins also are contraindicated in clients with cerebral hemorrhage or impaired liver function. Both the estrogens and progestins are classified as pregnancy category X drugs and are contraindicated during pregnancy. Estrogens are used cautiously in clients with gallbladder disease, hypercalcemia (may lead to severe hypercalcemia in clients with breast cancer and bone metastasis), cardiovascular disease, and liver impairment. Cardiovascular complications are greater in women who smoke and use estrogen.

Adverse reactions to these drugs are similar to those with other cholinergic blocking drugs. They include the following: Dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation or diarrhea, decreased production of tears, decreased sweating, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, dim vision, and urinary hesitancy Nausea and vomiting, nervousness, vertigo, headache, rash, and mental confusion (particularly in older adults) When reviewing adverse reactions with a client, it is important to know that before a drug is eliminated consider extended-release (ER) formulas. These drugs release less drug all at one time in the system, as a result, uncomfortable adverse reactions associated with cholinergic blockers are reduced. Clients should be told that antispasmodic drugs can discolor the urine (dark orange to brown) and stain undergarments that come in contact with the urine. — location: [26334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=26334) ^ref-60831

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions are primarily gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and include the following: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Abdominal pain or stomatitis Other generalized body system reactions include: Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, weakness, and peripheral neuropathy Rash, pruritus, photosensitivity reactions, and leg cramps When these drugs are given in large doses, clients may experience burning on urination and bladder irritation; this should not be mistaken for a continued infection. Nitrofurantoin has been known to cause acute and chronic pulmonary reactions. Clients should be told that phenazopyridine will discolor the urine (dark orange to brown) and permanently stain undergarments that come in contact with the urine. Contraindications and Precautions Anti-infectives are contraindicated in clients with a hypersensitivity to the drugs and during pregnancy (pregnancy category C) and lactation. One exception is nitrofurantoin, which is classified as a pregnancy category B drug and is used with caution during pregnancy. The anti-infectives should be used cautiously in those with renal or hepatic impairment. Clients who are allergic to tartrazine (a food dye) should not take methenamine (Hiprex). This drug is used cautiously in clients with gout, because it may cause crystals to form in the urine. Nitrofurantoin is used cautiously in clients with cerebral arteriosclerosis, diabetes, or a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. — location: [27046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27046) ^ref-55252

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions from the administration of vaccines or toxoids are usually mild. Chills, fever, muscular aches and pains, rash, and lethargy may be present. Pain and tenderness at the injection site may also occur. Although rare, a hypersensitivity reaction may occur. Some people concerned with egg allergies have refused vaccination. For these individuals, many of the routine vaccines, such as the yearly influenza vaccine, have an alternative preparation that is not made with eggs. The Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents provides a listing of the typical adverse reactions. Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the agent or any component of it. Allergy to eggs is a concern with some vaccines. It is recommended to see a primary health care provider familiar with egg allergies for vaccination if an allergy is suspected. Some people with “hive-only” reactions are able to tolerate vaccines without a problem (ACIP, 2012). The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines are contraindicated in clients who have had an allergic reaction to gelatin, neomycin, or a previous dose of one of the vaccines. The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, because of the danger of birth defects. Women are instructed to avoid becoming pregnant at least 3 months after receiving these vaccines. Vaccines and toxoids are contraindicated during acute febrile illnesses, leukemia, lymphoma, immunosuppressive illness or drug therapy, and nonlocalized cancer. Always ask about allergy history before preparing a vaccine for administration. See Box 47.5 for additional information on the contraindications to immunologic agents. — location: [27503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27503) ^ref-31462

BOX 47.5 Contraindications to Immunization Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever. Anaphylactoid reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing [dyspnea], hypotension, and shock). Known allergy to vaccine or vaccine constituents, particularly gelatin, eggs, or neomycin. Individuals with an immunologic deficiency should not receive a vaccine (virus is transmissible to the immunocompromised individual). Immunizations are postponed during the administration of steroids, radiation therapy, and antineoplastic (anticancer) drug therapy. Viral vaccines against measles, rubella, and mumps should not be given to pregnant women. Clients who experience severe systemic or neurologic reactions after a previous dose of the vaccine should not be given any additional doses. — location: [27517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27517) ^ref-22749

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to immune globulins are rare. However, local tenderness and pain at the injection site may occur. The most common adverse reactions include urticaria, angioedema, erythema, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, headache, chills, and fever. Adverse reactions, if they occur, may last for several hours. Systemic reactions are extremely rare, with the exception of immune globulins given to prevent posttransplant rejection. These immune globulins are made from equine (horse) or rabbit serum and can produce anaphylactic reactions. They should be administered only under the direction of a physician specializing in transplantation medicine. The antivenins may cause various reactions, with hypersensitivity being the most severe. Some antivenins are prepared from equine serum, and if a client is sensitive to equine serum, serious reactions or death may result. The immediate reactions usually occur within 30 min after administration of the antivenin. Symptoms include apprehension; flushing; itching; urticaria; edema of the face, tongue, and throat; cough; dyspnea; vomiting; cyanosis; and collapse. Other adverse reactions are included in the Summary Drug Table: Immunization Agents. — location: [27569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27569) ^ref-54215

Contraindications and Precautions Immunologic agents are used with extreme caution in individuals with a history of allergies. Sensitivity testing may be performed in individuals with a history of allergies. Because of the potential harm to a fetus, no adequate studies have been conducted in pregnant women, and it is also not known whether these agents are excreted in breast milk. Thus the immunologic agents (pregnancy category C) are used with caution in pregnant women and during lactation. The immune globulins are contraindicated in clients with a history of allergic reactions after administration of human immunoglobulin preparations and in individuals with isolated immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (individuals could have an anaphylactic reaction to subsequent administration of blood products that contain IgA). — location: [27578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=27578) ^ref-3673

Adverse Reactions Because the interferons activate the immune response, a cluster of symptoms similar to fighting influenza occur. These are referred to as “flu-like symptoms” because they mimic the bodily response to fight the flu. Flu-like symptoms generally include: Chills Cough Fever Headache Malaise (generalized discomfort) These adverse reactions are typically treated with acetaminophen and antihistamines. PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS Patti et al. (2020) found that drug administration during evening hours reduced flu-like symptoms compared with those clients who injected themselves in the morning. Other symptoms may include nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, reduced appetite, or diarrhea. Skin rashes, injection pain and inflammation, edema in the extremities, and antibody development can occur. Given parenterally, injection sites are rotated to reduce site reactions. Switching to a drug with less frequent dosing (three times/week to weekly drug) may help reduce injection site irritation and increase client compliance with the dosing schedule. — location: [28057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28057) ^ref-27548

Interferons adverse

---
Contraindications and Precautions Interferons are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, confusion, and manic behavior have been noted in clients both with and without a psychiatric history. Asymptomatic elevation in liver enzyme levels has occurred; therefore, clients should be cautioned regarding alcohol intake while using the drug. Caution is used when administering to clients with cardiac or liver disease, a history of seizure disorder, and thyroid problems. A reduction in WBC count makes clients susceptible to infection. Immunomodulators are not started during pregnancy, unless the woman is at high risk of MS activity. When on interferons, they are stopped when pregnancy is confirmed. Interferon has been found in breast milk (Hale, 2012). — location: [28070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28070) ^ref-28179

Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions CSFs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Filgrastim is used cautiously in clients with hypothyroid disease. The CSFs are pregnancy category C drugs, and caution is used when the client is breastfeeding. Pegfilgrastim can cause a sickle cell crisis in those with the disease. CSFs can cause hypersensitive reactions and should be treated with antihistamines, steroids, and bronchodilators to maintain their use. These drugs can stimulate cancer cell growth in cancer types that are stimulated by growth factors. An even higher increase in neutrophil count can occur when these drugs are taken with lithium, a drug used for the manic phase of mood disorders. — location: [28139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28139) ^ref-1315

Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Thrombopoietin drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. These drugs are used cautiously in clients with renal failure and those with liver failure. Clients should be monitored for cataract (eye) formation. It is a pregnancy category C drug, so women should use effective contraception and lactating clients should stop breastfeeding. Discontinuing either eltrombopag or romiplostim may result in platelet counts lower than the original diagnosed counts. — location: [28165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28165) ^ref-28301

Contraindications and Precautions Epoetin alfa is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension, those needing an emergency transfusion, and those with a hypersensitivity to human albumin. Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension or in those allergic to the drug. Polycythemia (an overload of RBCs in the circulation) can occur if the hemoglobin is not carefully monitored and the dosage is too high. This can result in increased mortality, serious cardio or thromboembolic events in any client, and possible tumor progression in cancer clients. Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are used with caution in clients with hypertension, heart disease, congestive heart failure, or a history of seizures. Both these drugs are pregnancy category C drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [28217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28217) ^ref-57676

Contraindications and Precautions Iron supplements are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Iron compounds are contraindicated in clients with hemochromatosis or hemolytic anemia. Iron compounds are used cautiously in clients with hypersensitivity to aspirin because these clients may have a hypersensitivity to the tartrazine or sulfite content of some iron compounds. The parenteral form of iron can cause anaphylactic-type reactions and should be used only when oral supplement is contraindicated. — location: [28247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28247) ^ref-18735

Adverse Reactions Few adverse reactions are associated with the administration of folic acid. Rarely, parenteral administration may result in allergic hypersensitivity. Contraindications and Precautions Folic acid and leucovorin are contraindicated for treating pernicious anemia or for other anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid is a pregnancy category A drug and is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to experience folate deficiency because folic acid requirements increase during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a folate deficiency are at increased risk for complications of pregnancy and fetal abnormalities. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folate during pregnancy is 0.4 mg/day and during lactation, 0.26–0.28 mg/day. Although the potential for fetal harm appears remote, the drug should be used cautiously and only within the RDA guidelines. — location: [28279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28279) ^ref-61924

Adverse Reactions Mild diarrhea and itching have been reported with the administration of vitamin B12. Other adverse reactions that may be seen include a marked increase in RBC production, acne, peripheral vascular thrombosis, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Vitamin B12 is contraindicated in clients who are allergic to cyanocobalamin. Vitamin B12 is a pregnancy category A drug if administered orally and a pregnancy category C drug if given parenterally. Vitamin B12 is administered cautiously during pregnancy and in clients with pulmonary disease and those with anemia. Alcohol, neomycin, and colchicine may decrease the absorption of oral vitamin B12. — location: [28307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28307) ^ref-15790

Adverse Reactions Because these drugs interfere with the immune system, common adverse reactions include headache, chills, and fever. Clients taking biologics may also feel nauseated or experience GI distress. Other adverse reactions experienced are itching, dizziness, and myalgias. Calcineurin inhibitors may cause gum hyperplasia, hair growth, or tremors. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Vaccination with live virus (such as the chickenpox or measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccines) should not be given if the client is on an immunosuppressant agent. Because these agents decrease immunity, there is an increased risk of infection. Therefore, clients should be routinely monitored for neutropenia and infectious diseases. Clients with HIV+ should not take alefacept (used for plaque psoriasis). Calcineurin inhibitors are nephrotoxic in high doses and the BUN should be monitored frequently. Cardiac arrhythmias are more likely to occur if taking calcineurin inhibitors with antiarrhythmic medications. Severe reduction in red cells, white cells, and platelets is seen when those taking IMDH inhibitors are also taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for hypertension. Many of the immunosuppressant agents interact with grapefruit juice and other citrus; consult a clinical nutritionist for client instruction on dietary restrictions. — location: [28715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28715) ^ref-19991

Adverse Reactions Central Nervous System Reactions Headache Dizziness GI System Reactions Nausea Abdominal pain Immune System Reactions Infection, skin eruptions Upper respiratory infection (URI) with cough Antibody development Infusion Reactions Many mAbs are administered intravenously (IV) or by subcutaneous injection. During IV infusion a hypersensitive reaction may occur. This is due to the sensitivity of the client to the tissue of origin of the mAb. Mouse and human tissues are used to make the drugs. When mAbs are composed of more mouse tissue than human tissue, a hypersensitive reaction is more likely to be experienced. Also, infusion-related reactions are more likely to occur during the first infusion than in subsequent treatments. Table 49.1 lists the adverse reactions potentially seen in an infusion reaction. Table 49.1 Components of Infusion Reactions Body System Adverse Reactions Generalized Fever, chills, rigors, sweating, warm feeling Cardiovascular Chest pain, palpitations, hypo-/hypertension, tachy-/bradycardia, arrhythmia, edema, ischemia, infarction, cardiac arrest CNS Throbbing headache, dizziness, confusion, LOC Integumentary Rash, pruritis, urticaria, erythema, tearing, angioedema GI Nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, diarrhea, abdominal cramps/bloating GU Incontinence, uterine cramping, renal impairment Multiple sclerosis Arthralgias, myalgia, fatigue, tumor pain, hypotonia Respiratory Cough, dyspnea, nasal congestion, rhinitis, sneezing, hoarseness, tachypnea, wheezing, tightness, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, stridor, cyanosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome — location: [28768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28768) ^ref-25524

Contraindications and Precautions mAbs should not be used if a person has an active, severe infection. Live vaccine should not be given directly before, during, or immediately after mAb use. Viral infections, such as hepatitis B may be reactivated during therapy, and antiviral treatment should be initiated. Monitor for adverse reactions in clients with cardiac and renal impairment (hypertension and proteinuria). Observe for GI distress, change in bowel habits, and progress to colitis and possible bowel perforation. mAbs can cross the placenta and cause fetal harm; therefore, women are cautioned to use effective birth control and should not use the drug when pregnant. Lactation is discouraged during and 6 months after ending mAb treatment. — location: [28802](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=28802) ^ref-6358

Adverse reactions to traditional chemotherapy drugs can be viewed in three different time frames: immediate (during the actual administration), during therapy cycles, and long term (many years later, during survivorship). Immediate adverse reactions occur as a result of administration. These include nausea and vomiting from highly emetic drugs or the potential of intravenous (IV) extravasation (leakage into the surrounding tissues) of irritating solutions. Traditional chemotherapy drugs are potentially toxic, and their administration is often associated with serious adverse reactions. At times, some of these adverse effects are allowed because the only alternative is to stop treatment of cancer. A treatment plan is developed — location: [29405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=29405) ^ref-8744

Antibiotics dactinomycin daunorubicin doxorubicin mitoxantrone. Antimetabolites cytarabine methotrexate. Plant Alkaloid irinotecan. An example of a treatment for an adverse reaction is the administration of an antiemetic and IV fluids with electrolytes when severe vomiting is anticipated. When the drugs listed in Box 50.1 are given, antiemetic protocols should always be followed to reduce adverse reactions. Some drugs, such as platinum-based agents, may damage certain organs during administration. Again, prechemotherapy protocols for IV fluid administration are initiated to prevent adverse reactions.

adverse reactions occur as the result of action on these cells. Adverse reactions common to many of the traditional chemotherapy drugs include bone marrow suppression (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), stomatitis (inflammation of lining tissues), diarrhea, and hair loss. The most common reactions are leukopenia (reduced white blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (reduced platelets), which may cause cycles of chemotherapy to be delayed until blood cell counts can be raised. Some drugs, especially the alkaloids, affect the nervous system. These adverse reactions can range from a peripheral tingling sensation to hand and foot syndrome (tiny capillary leaks in extremities, causing symptoms from skin color changes to numbness). Because the drugs used to treat cancer are effective, many people are living with the disease either cured or in remission. Some of the adverse reactions to traditional chemotherapy drugs can have long-lasting effects. These include damage to the gonads, causing fertility problems, and to other specific organ systems, leading to cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic problems.

Cytokines create an immune response, similar to having influenza and thus the symptoms experienced are referred to as “flu-like” symptoms. These symptoms include: Chills — location: [30348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30348) ^ref-16162

Cough Fever Headache Malaise Other symptoms may include nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, reduced appetite, or diarrhea. Skin rashes, injection pain and inflammation, edema in the extremities, and antibody development can occur. Capillary leak syndrome can occur due to increased vascular permeability. As a result of greater permeability, fluid leaks out of the circulation and into surrounding tissues, causing edema and dangerously low blood flow, which in turn can damage organs. Cytokine storm may also occur where the body is flooded with cytokines and again can lead to tissue damage or death if untreated. — location: [30350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30350) ^ref-23567

Interferons are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. A serious reaction of interferons may include neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, confusion, and manic behavior, which have been noted in clients both with and without a psychiatric history. Asymptomatic elevation in liver enzymes has occurred; therefore, clients should be cautioned regarding alcohol intake while using the drug. Caution is used when administering to clients with cardiac or liver disease, history of seizure disorder, and thyroid problems. A reduction in white blood cells makes clients susceptible to infection. Immunomodulators are not started during pregnancy. When the client is on cytokines, they are stopped when pregnancy is confirmed. Cytokines have been found in breast milk (Hale, 2012); therefore, lactation is discouraged. — location: [30356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30356) ^ref-53828

These drugs tend to have less adverse reactions than traditional chemotherapy because they do not interfere with healthy cells. Integumentary adverse reactions can range from rash to Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Infusion reactions may appear as a hypersensitive reaction; this is due to the sensitivity of the client to the tissue of origin of the mAb. mAbs composed of more human tissue than nonhuman are less likely to have a reaction than those mAbs with more mouse tissue. Fatal infusion-related reactions are more likely to occur during the first infusion than in subsequent treatments. Table 51.1 lists the adverse reactions potentially seen in an infusion reaction. — location: [30388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30388) ^ref-35711

Monoclonal antibodies should not be used if a person has an active, severe infection. Live vaccine should not be given directly before, during, or immediately after mAbs. Viral infections, such as hepatitis B may be reactivated during therapy, and antiviral treatment should be initiated. Clients being treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma with high tumor burden (volume) should prophylactically be treated for the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia). Monitor for adverse reactions in clients with cardiac and renal impairment. mAbs can cross the placenta and cause fetal harm; therefore, women are cautioned to use effective birth control and should not use the drug when pregnant. Lactation is discouraged during and 6 months after ending mAbs treatment. Owing to the manner in which monoclonal antibodies are named, they can be confused with each other easily. Be mindful to check the name carefully. Box 51.1 discusses the methodology used in naming the drugs; this can be helpful in drug recognition. BOX 51.1 Naming of Monoclonal Antibodies When looking at a list of monoclonal antibody names, to the untrained eye, it appears to be an odd assortment of letters. Yet the arrangement of those letters is very specific and designed to help in the understanding of mAbs naming and function. Let us use the example of a drug made to treat leukemia: riTUXimab (Rituxan). This is a drug that can be confused with other drugs, therefore part of the name TUX is capitalized to heighten awareness, it does not… — location: [30413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30413) ^ref-24715

Adverse reactions are typically inflammatory related and called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They can start as generalized feelings of malaise and progress to life-threatening issues if not addressed quickly when identified (Rubin, 2015). Integumentary System Reactions Common adverse reactions of skin, nails, and hair include the following: Skin problems (rash, dry skin, nail changes, hair depigmentation) Photosensitivity Gastrointestinal System Reactions Diarrhea progressing to colitis, hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes are common adverse reactions. For clients receiving sunitinib for gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, there is a rare but serious risk of bowel perforation (Kim, 2014). Other Reactions Thyroid inflammation Pulmonary symptoms Neurological changes (hand and foot syndrome) Inflammatory arthritis Acute pancreatitis Inflammatory endocrine issues Not all adverse reactions indicate a problem. Sometimes the reaction is a signal that the drug is working to kill the tumor cell. For example, clients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib have better outcomes (cancer improves) when the client develops an acne-like rash during therapy (Petrelli, 2012). Likewise, if a client experiences increased blood pressure when treated with bevacizumab, they tend to have a better outcome, too (Cai, 2013). — location: [30488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30488) ^ref-63881

Treatment cancer vaccines involve making the drug from the client’s own tumor cells (autologous) or using many different cancer cells to induce a response (allogeneic). Clients are observed during and after infusion for reaction. Anaphylactic reactions may occur as an acute infusion reaction. Clients with cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be closely monitored during infusion. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, and muscle and joint pain. Because the drug is used to treat prostate cancer, it should not be given to women. — location: [30555](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=30555) ^ref-7802

Adverse Reactions Local irritation such as erythema, dryness, stinging or burning sensation, itching may occur, especially in the first 2–4 weeks of treatment. These reactions can become worse with the use of medicates, abrasive soaps or cleansers. Local reactions lessen with continued use over time. Sensitivity to weather extremes (hot or cold) may happen. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Those with a hypersensitivity to the drug or any components of it should not use retinoids. Preparations should not be used on damaged skin (cuts, sunburn, eczema). Hypersensitive reactions include facial edema, and should be stopped immediately. People should avoid sun or sun lamps while using and should not be used by pregnant women. There are no known drug interactions due to their limited use on the skin. — location: [31181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31181) ^ref-51049

Retinoids adverse and contra

Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to topical anti-infectives are usually mild. Occasionally, the client may experience a rash, itching, urticaria (hives), dermatitis, irritation, or redness, which may indicate a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the drug. Prolonged use of topical antibiotic preparations may result in a superficial superinfection (an overgrowth of bacterial or fungal microorganisms not affected by the anti-infective being administered). Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions These drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs or any components of the drug. The topical antibiotics are pregnancy category C drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. Acyclovir and penciclovir are pregnancy category B drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. The pregnancy categories of the antifungals are unknown except for econazole, which is in pregnancy category C, and ciclopirox, which is in pregnancy category B; both are used with caution during pregnancy and lactation. There are no significant interactions for the topical anti-infectives. — location: [31209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31209) ^ref-58760

Adverse Reactions Topical antiseptics and germicides provoke few adverse reactions. Occasionally, an individual may be allergic to the drug, and a skin rash or itching may occur. If an allergic reaction is noted, use of the topical drug is discontinued. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions These drugs are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the individual drug or any component of the preparation. There are no significant precautions or interactions when the drugs are used as directed. — location: [31233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31233) ^ref-34152

Topical antiseptics and germicides adverse and contra

---
Adverse Reactions Localized reactions may include burning, itching, irritation, redness, dryness of the skin, allergic contact dermatitis, and secondary infection. These reactions are more likely to occur if occlusive dressings are used. If liberally applied, some systemic absorption may occur. This is less likely when used as prescribed. Systemic reactions include hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression, Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria. Lifespan Considerations Pediatric. Because infants and children have a high ratio of skin surface area to body mass, they are at greater risk than adults for systemic adverse effects when treated with topical medication. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug; as monotherapy for bacterial skin infections; for use on the face, groin, or axilla (only the high-potency corticosteroids); and for ophthalmic use (may cause steroid-induced glaucoma or cataracts). The topical corticosteroids are not used as sole therapy in widespread plaque psoriasis. The topical corticosteroids are pregnancy category C drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. There are no significant interactions when these drugs are administered as directed. — location: [31247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31247) ^ref-2274

Topical corticosteroids adverse and contra

Reactions are localized to the skin tissues. Burning, itching, and skin redness are the primary local adverse reactions. Clients may develop photosensitivity of the skin and should stay out of direct sunlight, even when not using the product. Some individuals may experience flu-like symptoms. — location: [31279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31279) ^ref-2200

Topical immunomodulators adverse

---
Because of the risk of greater immunosuppression and susceptibility to infection, immunocompromised clients should not use topical immunomodulators. Long-term use is contraindicated because of risk of skin malignancy. Caution is taken when pregnant or lactating since these drugs in topical form have not been studied in these populations of women. Tacrolimus should not be taken by clients allergic to the macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin). Although not an immunomodulator, fluorouracil (an anticancer agent) is used to treat actinic keratosis topically. This agent causes redness and crusting of the skin. The cream should be handled like other chemotherapy agents and disposed of properly (see Chapter 50). Do not allow children, pets, or pregnant women to handle the agent or touch the cream when on the skin. — location: [31282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31282) ^ref-49157

Adverse Reactions These drugs may cause burning, itching, and skin irritation. Anthralin may cause skin irritation, as well as temporary discoloration of the hair and fingernails. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Topical antipsoriatics are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs. Anthralin and calcipotriene, pregnancy category C drugs, are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [31291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31291) ^ref-1476

Adverse Reactions The application of collagenase may cause mild, transient pain and possibly numbness and dermatitis. There is a low incidence of adverse reactions to collagenase. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions Topical enzyme preparations are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs, in wounds in contact with major body cavities or where nerves are exposed, and in fungating neoplastic ulcers. These drugs are pregnancy category B drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. Enzymatic activity may be impaired by certain detergents and heavy metal ions, such as mercury and silver, which are used in some antiseptics. The optimal pH for collagenase is 6–8. Higher or lower pH conditions decrease the enzyme’s activity. — location: [31304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31304) ^ref-41688

Keratolytics adverse

---
Keratolytics are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drugs and for use on moles, birthmarks, or warts with hair growing from them, on genital or facial warts, on warts on mucous membranes, or on infected skin. Prolonged use of the keratolytics in infants and in clients with diabetes or impaired circulation is contraindicated. Salicylic acid may cause salicylate toxicity with prolonged use. These drugs are pregnancy category C drugs and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. — location: [31319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31319) ^ref-35661

Occasionally, local irritation, dermatitis, rash, burning, stinging, and tenderness may be noted. Contraindications, Precautions, and Interactions These drugs are contraindicated in those with a known hypersensitivity to any component of the preparation. Topical anesthetics are used cautiously in clients receiving class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as tocainide and mexiletine, because the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. — location: [31329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31329) ^ref-592

Otic drugs are contraindicated in clients with a known hypersensitivity to the drugs. The otic drugs are used with caution during pregnancy and lactation. The pregnancy category of most of these drugs is unknown when they are used as otic drugs. Drugs to remove cerumen are not used if ear drainage, discharge, pain, or irritation is present; if the eardrum is perforated; or after ear surgery. Otic drugs are available in dropper bottles and can be dangerous if ingested. Therefore, store these drugs safely out of the reach of children and pets. If an allergy is suspected, the drug is not administered. No significant interactions have been reported with the use of otic preparations. — location: [31953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=31953) ^ref-6408

Although adverse reactions are rare, these drugs can cause visual impairment such as blurring of vision and local irritation and burning. These reactions are most often self-limiting and resolve if the client waits a few minutes. Visual impairment that does not clear within 30 minutes after therapy should be reported to the primary health care provider. Drugs to Treat Glaucoma Drugs used to treat glaucoma may cause transient local reactions and systemic reactions. Although side effects are usually mild they may include: Locally in or near the eye—burning and stinging, headache, visual blurring, tearing, foreign body sensation, ocular allergic reactions, and ocular itching Systemic effects—fatigue and drowsiness, palpations, nausea Prostaglandin analogs—slight iris color change, growth of eyelashes, drooping eyelids Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors—stomach upset, frequent urination Rho kinase inhibitors—reddened eyes, corneal deposits Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions associated with administration of the corticosteroid ophthalmic preparations include elevated IOP with optic nerve damage, loss of visual acuity, cataract formation, delayed wound healing, secondary ocular infection, exacerbation of corneal infections, dry eyes, ptosis, blurred vision, discharge, ocular pain, foreign body sensation, and pruritus. Antibiotics, and Sulfonamides Antibiotic and sulfonamide ophthalmic preparations are usually well tolerated, and few adverse reactions are seen. Local adverse reactions include occasional transient irritation, burning, itching, stinging, inflammation, and blurred vision. With prolonged or repeated use a superinfection may occur. Antiviral Drugs Administration of the antiviral ophthalmic preparations may cause local reactions such as irritation, pain, pruritus, inflammation, edema of the eyes or eyelids, foreign body — location: [32135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=32135) ^ref-43810

These drugs are contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. Clients wearing soft contact lenses should be cautioned, because the preservative in the drug may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and discoloration of the lenses may occur. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are in pregnancy category C (dapiprazole is pregnancy category B) and are used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation and in clients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes (may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia), and hyperthyroidism (may mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism). The client taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for ophthalmic reasons may experience increased or additive effects when the drugs are administered with the oral beta-adrenergic blockers. Coadministration of timolol and calcium antagonists may cause hypotension, left ventricular failure, and condition disturbances within the heart. There is a potential additive hypotensive effect when the beta-adrenergic blocking ophthalmic drugs are administered with the phenothiazines. Cholinesterase inhibitors are used cautiously in clients with myasthenia gravis (may cause additive adverse effects), before and after surgery, and in clients with chronic angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma or those with anatomically narrow angles (may cause papillary block and increase the angle blockage). When cholinesterase inhibitors are administered with systemic anticholinesterase drugs, there is a risk for additive effects. Individuals such as farmers, warehouse workers, or gardeners working with carbamate–organophosphate insecticides or pesticides are at risk for systemic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors from absorption of the pesticide or insecticide through the respiratory tract or the skin. Individuals working with pesticides or insecticides containing carbamate–organophosphate and taking a cholinesterase inhibitor should be advised to wear respiratory masks, change clothes frequently, and wash exposed clothes thoroughly. These drugs are used cautiously during pregnancy (epinephrine, pregnancy category B; apraclonidine, pregnancy category C) and lactation and in clients with cardiovascular disease, depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or Raynaud phenomenon. When brimonidine is used with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics, there is a risk for an additive CNS-depressant effect. Use the drugs cautiously in combination with antihypertensive drugs and cardiac glycosides because a synergistic effect may occur. Adrenergic-blocking drugs are contraindicated in clients with bronchial asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, heart block, cardiac failure, or cardiogenic shock, and in clients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any components of the drug. These drugs should not be used in conditions in which pupil constriction is not desirable, such as… — location: [32163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=32163) ^ref-32623

Hypokalemia Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mental depression, confusion, delayed or impaired thought processes, drowsiness, abdominal distention, decreased bowel sounds, paralytic ileus, muscle weakness or fatigue, flaccid paralysis, absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes, weak and irregular pulse, paresthesias, leg cramps, electrocardiographic changes. Hyperkalemia Irritability, anxiety, listlessness, mental confusion, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distress, GI hyperactivity, paresthesias, weakness and heaviness of the legs, flaccid paralysis, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, electrocardiographic changes. Sodium Normal laboratory values: 132–145 mEq/La Hyponatremia Cold and clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, apprehension, confusion, irritability, anxiety, hypotension, postural hypotension, tachycardia, headache, tremors, convulsions, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Hypernatremia Fever; hot, dry skin; dry, sticky mucous membranes; rough, dry tongue; edema; weight gain; intense thirst; excitement; restlessness; agitation; oliguria or anuria. aNormal laboratory values ranges vary according to equipment used. This is a general range of electrolyte normalcy. The specific facility policy manual or laboratory values sheet should be consulted for the normal ranges of all laboratory tests. Potassium is contraindicated in clients who are at risk for hyperkalemia, such as those with renal failure, oliguria, azotemia (the presence of nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood), anuria, severe hemolytic reactions, untreated Addison disease, acute dehydration, heat cramps, and any form of hyperkalemia. Potassium is used cautiously in clients with renal impairment or adrenal insufficiency, heart disease, metabolic acidosis, or prolonged or severe diarrhea. Concurrent use of potassium with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may result in an elevated serum potassium level. Potassium-sparing diuretics and salt substitutes used with potassium can produce severe hyperkalemia. The use of digitalis with potassium increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Magnesium (Mg++) Adverse reactions from magnesium administration are most likely related to overdose and may include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and circulatory collapse (see Box 54.4).

Sodium (Na+) Sodium as the salt (i.e., NaCl) has no adverse reactions except those related to overdose (see Box 54.4). In some instances, excessive oral use may produce nausea and vomiting. Sodium is contraindicated in clients with hypernatremia or fluid retention and when the administration of sodium or chloride could be detrimental. Sodium is used cautiously in surgical clients and those with circulatory insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, urinary tract obstruction, heart failure (HF), edema, or renal impairment. Sodium is a pregnancy category C drug and is used cautiously during pregnancy. — location: [32978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=32978) ^ref-20483

Calcium (Ca++) Irritation of the vein used for administration, tingling, a metallic or chalky taste, and “heat waves” may occur when calcium is given IV. Rapid IV administration (calcium gluconate) may result in bradycardia, vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Oral administration may result in GI disturbances. Administration of calcium chloride may cause peripheral vasodilation, a temporary fall in blood pressure, and local burning. Box 54.4 lists adverse reactions associated with hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia. — location: [32983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=32983) ^ref-21446

Extracellular electrolytes adverse 2

In some instances, excessive oral use of bicarbonate may produce nausea and vomiting. Some individuals may use sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) for the relief of GI disturbances such as pain, discomfort, symptoms of indigestion, and gas. Prolonged use of oral sodium bicarbonate or excessive doses of IV sodium bicarbonate may result in systemic alkalosis. Bicarbonate is contraindicated in clients losing chloride by continuous GI suction or through vomiting; in clients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, hypocalcemia, renal failure, or severe abdominal pain of unknown cause; and in those on sodium-restricted diets. Bicarbonate is used cautiously in clients with HF or renal impairment and those receiving glucocorticoid therapy. Bicarbonate is a pregnancy category C drug and is used cautiously during pregnancy. Oral administration of bicarbonate may decrease the absorption of ketoconazole. Increased blood levels of quinidine, flecainide, or sympathomimetics may occur when these agents are administered with bicarbonate. There is an increased risk of crystalluria when bicarbonate is administered with the fluoroquinolones. Possible decreased effects of lithium, methotrexate, chlorpropamide, salicylates, and tetracyclines may occur when these drugs are administered with sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is not administered within 2 hours of enteric-coated drugs because the protective enteric coating may disintegrate before the drug reaches the intestine. — location: [33106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FRF11YJ&location=33106) ^ref-25873
