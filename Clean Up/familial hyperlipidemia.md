**Familial [[hyperlipidemia]]** is a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of lipids (fats), such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the [[Blood]]. This condition is inherited, meaning it runs in families, and it can significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, at an early age.

There are different types of familial [[hyperlipidemia]], with the most common being:

1. **[[familial hypercholesterolemia]] (FH):** This type is caused by mutations in genes related to the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad cholesterol." People with FH have very high levels of LDL cholesterol from birth and are at high risk for early [[Heart]] attacks and other cardiovascular problems.

2. **Familial Combined [[hyperlipidemia]] (FCH):** This condition is characterized by elevated levels of both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. It often appears in adulthood and can be associated with obesity, diabetes, and high [[Blood]] pressure, further increasing the risk of [[Heart]] disease.

3. **Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia:** This rare type is due to mutations in the [[gene]] for apolipoprotein E, leading to the improper breakdown of certain lipoproteins. It results in elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, leading to an increased risk of peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease.

### Symptoms and Risks
- **Symptoms:** Often, there are no symptoms until a cardiovascular event occurs, such as a [[Heart]] attack. However, in some cases, physical signs like xanthomas (fatty deposits under the skin) or xanthelasmas (cholesterol deposits around the eyes) may be visible.
  
- **Risks:** Without treatment, individuals with familial [[hyperlipidemia]] are at a significantly increased risk of developing [[Atherosclerosis]] (narrowing of the arteries) and cardiovascular diseases at an early age.

### Diagnosis and Treatment
- **Diagnosis:** [[Blood]] tests are used to measure lipid levels, and [[genetic testing]] can confirm the diagnosis. Family history is also an important factor in diagnosing familial [[hyperlipidemia]].
  
- **Treatment:** Management typically involves lifestyle changes (such as diet, exercise, and smoking cessation) and medications like statins to lower cholesterol levels. In more severe cases, additional medications or treatments may be needed. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are crucial for managing the condition.

Early detection and treatment are key to reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with familial [[hyperlipidemia]].
