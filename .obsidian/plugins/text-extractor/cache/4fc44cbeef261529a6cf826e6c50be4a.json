The innermost EPIDERMAL layer is called the stratum germinativum. . This is where mitosis occurs to produce new epidermal cells. . The rate of mitosis is constant but increases from chronic abrasion to the skin as in a “Callus” forms. . New cells are formed and those are called KERATINOCYTES, these produce the protein KERATIN and a water repelling sealant. . The outermost layer of the epidermal layers is called Stratum Corneum, these cells resist abrasion and water entry and exit. ➢ 3 Layers of Skin: Epidermis, Dermis, Hypodermis - Hair: . Keeps dust and sweat out of the eyes and nostril hair, which filters air entering the nasal cavities. . Hair on the head provides THERMAL INSULATION - Nails: . Mitosis in the nail root is a continuous process to produce new Keratinized cells. . As these cells die, they form the visible nail. . Nails protect the ends of the digits from mechanical injury. - Receptors: . Sensory receptors for the cutaneous senses reside in the dermis. . Encapsulated nerve endings are specific for touch and pressure. . The sensitivity of an area of the skin is determined by the density of receptors present. - Glands: . Cutaneous exocrine glands lie within the dermis and secrete to the surface of the skin through ducts. . Sudoriferous glands (both eccrine and apocrine), sebaceous Glands(oil) ceruminous glands (cerumen), and ciliary glands (tears). - Blood vessels: . Blood vessels in the dermis serve the usual function of tissue nourishment. . Arterioles are also involved in maintaining body temperature. . Stressful situations can cause vasoconstriction in the dermis, which would allow blood to circulate to more VITAL organs such as your heart, liver, brain, or muscles. - Epidermis= Outermost later (No blood vessels) - Dermis= Inner Deeper layer (middle layer) . Abundance of blood vessels . Swear Glands . Sebaceous Glands . Nerve endings - Hypodermis= Subcutaneous Layer (Deepest layer) . Cushions, insulates, and stores energy. ➢ Functions of the skin: .

Mrs. Q’s voice fixin to put me to sleep Goodnight yall CHAPTER 55 ➢ Nursing care with burns: - 3 zones of tissue damage that occur with burns: . Hyperemia Injury: EPIDERMIS . Stasis Injury: DERMIS . Coagulation Injury: SUBCUTANEOUS . The amount of skin damage is related to the Temperature of the burning agent, the burning agent itself, the duration of exposure, the conductivity of tissue, and the thickness of the involved dermal structures. . When a patient with burns come in keep in mind that their normal body functions will be thrown off and will have Impaired ability to regulate temperature, there is an increased risk for infection, the sensory functions change, loss of fluids, impaired skin regeneration, and impaired secretory and excretory functions, interrupts blood supply. . Temperature of 100.4 or greater NOTIFY HCP!! . Heat denatures cellular protein. ➢ Systemic Responses: . Increased capillary . Permeability Leakage of plasma and proteins . Loss of intravascular volume . Decreased cardiac output. . Hypovolemic shock (This is an emergency; this is blood loss and fluid loss) . Decreased platelet function. . Leukocyte and platelet aggregation . Hypermetabolism, catabolism (can lead to water loss, stress responses) . Negative nitrogen balance (Body is losing protein, delay in healing time) . Hyperglycemia from stress response . Gastrointestinal complications (Due to the fluid shifts, dehydration and pain meds) . Renal insufficiency (Due to hypovolemic shock and decreased cardia output) . Pulmonary damage (Smoke inhalation) . Risk for infection 🩹BE SAFE🩹 . BE VIGILANT! It is not uncommon to administer massive volumes of intravenous fluids to severely burned patients. The patient must be closely monitored with hemodynamic monitoring to avoid fluid overload. 🔅NURSING CARE TIP: . For quick estimation of percentage of burn unjustly on an adult patient, the palm of your hand is about 1%. ➢ Depth: . Partial thickness = SUPERFICIAL . Partial thickness = DEEP . Full thickness ➢ Partial Thickness (Superficial): . 1st to second degree . Involves epidermis and papillae of dermis. . Bright red to pink, blanches, serum filled blisters, moist. . Sensitive to air, temperature, and touch . Heals in 7-10 days. ➢ Partial Thickness (Deep): . 2nd degree . Involves epidermis, half to seven eighths of dermis. . Blisters may be present, pink to light red to white, soft and pliable, blanching. . Pressure may be painful because of exposed nerve endings giving the greatest degree of pain. . . Heals in 14-21 day may need grafting to decrease scarring. ➢ Full Thickness: . 3rd-4th degree . Involves epidermis, dermis, tissue, muscle, and bone. . Snowy white, gray, or brown. The texture is firm and leathery. . No pain because nerve endings are destroyed, unless surrounded by areas of partial thickness burns. . Grafting is necessary to complete healing. 👵🏼Gerontological Issues: - Burn Injury and the Older Adult. Older adults face the greatest threat of dying in a fire as a result of several factors. Older adults have thinner skin. In addition, many suffer from comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, that can increase recovery time and lead to a longer hospital stay. Prevention measures for older adults should consider vision and hearing impairments as well as limited mobility. Individuals must be able to evacuate in case of a fire and seek help if a burn injury occurs. Nurses should target prevention measures toward the most common activities that can lead to fire or burn injury: smoking and cooking. ➢ Diagnostic Tests: . History & Physical . CBC . BUN . Glucose . Electrolytes . Serum Protein, Albumin . Urine cultures . Clotting studies . X-Rays . Electrocardiogram . ABGs (Arterial blood gas) . Cultures ➢ Rule of Nines classifies the percentage of burns.: - Adult burns: . 18% front . 18% back . 9% each arm . 9% Entire head and neck . 18% each leg . 1% Genitalia ➢ Therapeutic Measures for Major burns: - Emergent Stage: (STAGE 1) . ABC’s (Airway ALWAYS comes first) . Stop burning process. . Stabilize related injuries . IV fluids (Not uncommon to administer massive volumes of fluids to severely burned patients monitor with, hemodynamic monitoring to avoid fluid overload) . Pain control (Give before you do dressing changes, IV quickest route) - Acute Stage: (STAGE 2) . Clean, debride, dress. . Prevent infection. . Skin grafting if needed. . Control patients' pain . Maintain nutrition & fluid and electrolyte balance . Check return of Distal pulses (Is escharotomy done) - Rehabilitation Stage: (STAGE 3) . Reconstructive surgery . Prevent contraction. . Physical Therapy . Psychosocial care . Keep patient in the most comfortable position (Flexion) . The burn wound will shorten until it meets an opposing force. ➢ Skin Grafts: . Most common autografts: - Split thickness skin graft (STSG) . Used in cosmetics effects (face, neck, upper chest, breast, hands) . Sheet graft or Meshed graft - Full Thickness Skin Graft: (FTSG) . These grafts are used over areas of muscle mass, soft tissue loss, hands, feet, and eyelids. - Autograft: . Graft from the patient's unburned skin that is placed on the clean, excised burn. ➢ Nursing diagnosis: . Impaired Gas Exchange . Impaired Skin Integrity . Deficient Fluid Volume . Acute Pain . Impaired Physical Mobility . Ineffective Peripheral Tissue Perfusion . Risk for Infection CHAPTER 13 ➢ Primary Survey: . AIRWAY . BREATHING . CIRCULATION . Disability/ central nervous system . Exposure ➢ Airway: . Should NOT be hyperextended. . Should NOT be flexed. . Should NOT be rotated until spinal injury is ruled out. *IF performing CPR with a spinal injury the JAW THRUST maneuver must be used rather than chin lift maneuver to avoid movement of the head and neck. . The airway is inspected for obstruction (IF there is an obstruction, they are removed using suction) ➢ Breathing: . After the airway is opened, the patient is assessed for spontaneous breathing and respiratory rate and depth. . The nurse observes whether the patient's chest rises and falls spontaneously. . Breath sounds are auscultated bilaterally. . The patient can be ventilated with a mouth-to- face mask or a bag-valve face mask. . For an unconscious patient, endotracheal intubation is the preferred method of establishing and maintaining an airway. It protects the lungs from aspiration. ➢ Circulation: . The carotid pulse is palpated for quality and rate. . The skin is inspected for color and temperature. External bleeding is controlled by external pressure. . Elevation is used as needed. . Conditions that can compromise circulation include internal bleeding, shock resulting from hemorrhage, or major burns. . Large-gauge intravenous IV cannulas (16- or 18-gauge) are inserted for fluid resuscitation i If the patient does not have a pulse, CPR is started. If a pulse can be palpated, vital signs are taken and recorded. ➢ Disability: . To detect a serious central nervous system injury, a brief neurologic assessment is conducted (this determines level of consciousness) . Levels of consciousness can include alert (A) and responds to verbal stimuli (V), responds to painful stimuli (P), or is unresponsive (U) ➢ Exposure: . Respect the patient’s dignity as this is done. . Keep the patient covered to reduce heat loss & prevent shivering. . Look for injuries and medical alert jewelry ➢ Secondary Survey: - Identifies areas of soft injury or medical problems that are not life-threatening but DO require treatment. . For patient with severe trauma . Rapid head to toe assessment . Keep covered and warm ➢ Shock: (Progressively decreasing blood pressure) . Circulatory failure . Decreased cellular perfusion ➢ Signs & Symptoms of shock: . Restlessness and anxiety . Thirst. . Pale skin color. . Cold and clammy skin . Weak, rapid, thready pulse. . Shallow, rapid, labored breathing . . Gradually and steadily falling blood pressure. . Altered level of consciousness ➢ 4 Types of shock: . Hypovolemic Shock = decrease in circulating blood volume . Cardiogenic Shock = results from cardiac failure . Obstructive Shock = caused by a blockage of blood flow in the cardiovascular circuit outside the heart. .

Determine the patients' level of consciousness . Pulse indicates the strength of the heart's contractions . Monitor BPs frequently. . Skin temperature and color changes can occur (insufficient circulation produces pale, white, or ashen skin) . Patients with shock have longer or absent Cap refill. . Administer patients' oxygen level (Oxygen greater than 90%) 🔅NURSING CARE TIP: - One of the causes of anaphylactic shock is a latex allergy reaction. The use of latex-free products limits latex exposure. This reduces the risk of developing a latex allergy. ➢ Major Trauma: - Mechanism of injury: . Transfers environmental energy to person - Penetrating injuries: . Sharp objects, Projectiles . If sharp objects are still in patient, stabilize it so it remains in place - Blunt Injuries (closed): . Trauma extends to surrounding structures ➢ Surface Trauma: . Closed wound (Contusion, Hematoma) . Open Wound (Abrasion, puncture, Laceration, Avulsion, Amputation) ➢ Tetanus: - A disease caused by the bacillus clostridium tetani . Its spores enter through an opening in the skin or a wound . The first sign of tetanus may be jaw muscle spasms (lockjaw) . Emergency treatment includes hospitalization, airway, maintenance, human tetanus immune globulin, muscle spasm control, wound care, and tetanus toxoid booster. . Prophylactic tetanus vaccinations should begin at 2 months of age and followed by a series of pediatric immunizations until 15 years old. . Tetanus vaccine boosters every 10 years ➢ Tetanus Signs & Symptoms: . Lockjaw (Jaw spasms) . Abdominal rigidly . Dysphasia, Dyspnea . Muscle stiffness . Seizures .

Suspect Spinal I just with ALL the trauma patients . STABALIZE spine (neck, back) until injury ruled out. . Maintain Airway ➢ Chest Trauma: - Could damage the Heart & Lungs such as: . Pericardial Tamponade= results when blood or fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac. This increases pressure around the heart. . Hemothorax = Blood leaking into the intrapleural space collapses the lung . Tension pneumothorax = Air is trapped in the pleural space during exhalation, this puts pressure on the unaffected lung. . Fail Chest= condition of chest wall caused by two or more fractures on each affected rib, resulting in a segment of rib that is not attached on either end ➢ Treatment: . Oxygen . Chest tube as needed . Surgery ➢ Abdominal Trauma: . Spleen, liver, bladder, intestinal damage (Rich blood supply) . Monitor for shock . Abdominal distention (Firm, tender) . IV fluids .
