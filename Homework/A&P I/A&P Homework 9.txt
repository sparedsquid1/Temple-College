Upon entering your house, you smell a cake baking in the oven. What division of the peripheral nervous system is responsible?
somatic sensory division

Which nervous system division is responsible for the integration of sensory information?
central nervous system

Which of the following is controlled by the somatic motor division of the PNS?
skeletal muscle

Julie sensed a mosquito land on her arm and she swatted it away with her hand. Which specific PNS division was responsible for the voluntary movement of her hand?
somatic motor division

The autonomic nervous system does NOT carry signals to:
skeletal muscle

What part of the neuron is a process that can generate and conduct action potentials?
axon

What specific part of the neuron communicates with a target cell and serves as the secretory region of the cell?
axon terminals

The most common type of neuron in the human body is:
multipolar

Which of the following best describes a bipolar neuron?
one axon and one dendrite

What type of neuron, found within the CNS, performs the job of information processing?
interneurons (association neurons)

Bundles of axons known as tracts are part of the:
central nervous system

Astrocytes and tight junctions create a barrier to viruses and bacteria known as:
the blood-brain barrier

Ependymal cells __________.
circulate cerebrospinal fluid

Which of the following is an effect of myelination?
Myelination increases the speed of conduction of action potentials

In the CNS damaged neurons almost never regenerate. However, in the PNS a neuron can regenerate, but only if:
the cell body remains intact

Resting membrane potential is maintained by the sodium-potassium ion pump, or Na+/K+ ATPase, which brings:
two potassium ions into the cytosol and three sodium ions into the extracellular fluid

What specific type of gated channel opens or closes in response to physical distortion of the membrane surface, such as vibrations or pressure?
mechanically-gated

If a resting axon increases its permeability to sodium ions:
the influx of sodium ions will increase and the membrane will depolarize

What membrane potential must generally be met in order to achieve threshold?
-55 mV

Repolarization begins as:
voltage-gated potassium ion channels activate to move potassium out of the cell

Where are the cell bodies of lower motor neurons located?
anterior horn of spinal gray matter

Voltage-gated sodium channels are activated:
only if the cell is depolarized to threshold

The majority of synapses in the nervous system are:
chemical

What brain region is responsible for learning, memory, and personality?
cerebrum

The cerebellum functions in:
coordination of movement

Visual stimuli that arrive in the thalamus are relayed to the:
primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe

The primary motor cortex of the right cerebral hemisphere:
controls the motor activity on the left side of the body

In 1848, Phineas Gage sustained a brain injury when an iron rod pierced through his left prefrontal cerebral cortex. What do you think was the result?
Gage's personality, behavior, and psychological state changed

What results when the corpus callosum is cut?
Communication between the right and left cerebral hemispheres would be impaired

What is NOT part of the diencephalon?
Medulla oblongata

The thalamus receives information from all of the following senses EXCEPT for:
smell

Damage to the substantia nigra of the midbrain would be indicated by problems with:
movement

What type of fiber carries information from the frontal lobe of the right cerebral hemisphere to the occipital lobe of the same cerebral hemisphere?
association fibers

posterior horn of spinal gray matter

What part of the brain modifies the activity of upper motor neurons to produce voluntary movements and inhibit involuntary ones?
basal nuclei
