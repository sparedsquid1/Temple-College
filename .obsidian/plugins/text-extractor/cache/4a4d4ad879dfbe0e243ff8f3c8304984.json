Nursing- the most ill person gets the most immediate care Meet the priority within Watson's framework of caring Is you decision based on Watson's caring framework? If you apply Maslow's and Watson's theories, you will be successful at setting meaningful priorities. CURE (Critical, Urgent, Routine, Extra) Hierarchy Critical • Patient with difficulty breathing, severe pain, changing vital signs Urgent • Giving PRN meds • Verifying a medication order Routine • Patient teaching • Performing physical assessment Extra • Getting a drink for a family member, getting warm blanklet Need for Priority Setting • Scenario 1 & 2 Page 178 Read and Review • The ability for nurses to set priorities is essential • YOU are the patient's advocate • YOU are the 24-hour caregiver • YOU are making decisions that will determine patient outcomes Need for Priority Setting One constant in healthcare is that tomorrow it will change You must be a lifelong learner Share your knowledge and skills with colleagues Use \"best evidence-based practice\" Be a role model Need for Priority Setting Fewer nurses translate to poorer care Nurses need to be able to organize and reorganize their patient care activities based on changes occurring throughout the shift (cognitive stacking) Example: Giving a new medication during peak medication administration times Which Patient is the Priority? A) A patient reports a headache 5/10 pain scale and request acetaminophen B) A patient is requesting pain medication before going to Physical Therapy C) A patient with a left total knee who is postop day 2 wants you to assess their knee dressing with is leaking serosanguineous fluid D) A patient calls you reporting chest pain Prioritizing Patient Care The nurse is assigned to the following clients. 1.

A client who is undergoing surgery for a hysterectomy on the following day Who should the nurse assess first, second, third, fourth? It Starts with the Ability to Make Good Decisions Basic considerations for decision making • Decision can be make based on laws, policy, and procedure mandates (medication administration) • Decision you make in an emergency based on your knowledge (change in patient's condition) • The decision you have time to process before making it (which nursing school to attend) Ability to make meaningful decisions depends on your knowledge base Decision-Making Steps • Steps are similar to nursing process! • Define the problem • Determine the most desirable outcome • Identify solutions for the problem • Evaluate all solutions for effectiveness • Select and implement the solution • Evaluate the solution selected for effectiveness-if not effective-start process over","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
