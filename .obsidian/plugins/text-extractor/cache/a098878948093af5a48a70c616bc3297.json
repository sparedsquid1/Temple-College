the most movable organ of the mouth ▪ Adults have 32 permanent teeth ▪ Cuspids, incisors, bicuspids, and molars 3 4 6/8/2024 3 FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION (CONT’D) ▪ Mouth ▪ Receives food and breaks it down into smaller pieces; mixes food with saliva and starts the digestive process ▪ Parotid glands ▪ Largest salivary glands ▪ One on each side ▪ Located anterior and inferior to the ear ▪ Secrete saliva into the mouth ▪ Begins digestion of starches FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION (CONT’D) ▪ Pharynx ▪ Connects the nasal and oral cavities to the esophagus; food is forced into the pharynx by the tongue ▪ Esophagus ▪ Muscular tube approximately 20 cm long ▪ Propels food into the stomach from the pharynx using muscular contraction ▪ Lining secretes mucus 5 6 6/8/2024 4 FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION (CONT’D) ▪ Stomach ▪ Located in the upper-left quadrant of the abdomen; has a capacity of approximately 1.5 L ▪ Has two sphincters ▪ Is a temporary storage place for food ▪ Mixes food with digestive juices ▪ Changes food into a semiliquid state ▪ Begins the digestion of proteins ▪ Absorbs vitamin B12 FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION (CONT’D) ▪ Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum): mixes food with secretions from liver and pancreas; finishes digestion; absorbs nutrients ▪ Large intestine (ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon; rectum; anus; cecum): absorbs fluid and electrolytes; eliminates waste products ▪ Liver and gallbladder: concentrate, store, and secrete bile into the duodenum ▪ Pancreas: secretes digestive juices; produces insulin 7 8 6/8/2024 5 CHANGES IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THAT OCCUR WITH AGING Dental caries and tooth loss Decrease a person’s ability to chew food Decreased gag reflex Increases the risk of aspiration Decreased sense of taste May lead to loss of appetite CHANGES IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THAT OCCUR WITH AGING (CONT’D) ▪ Decreased muscle tone at sphincters ▪ Increases risk of esophageal reflux ▪ Decreased gastric secretions ▪ May interfere with digestion of food ▪ Decreased peristalsis ▪ Increased risk of constipation 9 10 6/8/2024 6 METABOLISM ▪ Process in which large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules ▪ Makes energy available to the organism ▪ Enables absorbed nutrients to enter bloodstream following digestion ▪ Digestion converts food into chemical substances such as proteins and simple sugars to be used by the body for energy production and cellular metabolism DIETARY GUIDELINES ▪ USDA MyPlate ▪ Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products ▪ Includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts ▪ Is low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars 11 12 6/8/2024 7 PROTEIN ▪ Constant supply essential for rebuilding and replacing body tissues ▪ Plays a role in hormone production, fluid balance, antibody production, and transportation of nutrients ▪ Supplies approximately 4 calories/g ▪ Composed of amino acids ▪ 9 essential ▪ 11 nonessential FOOD SOURCES: PROTEIN ▪ Animal sources ▪ Red meat, eggs, milk and milk products, poultry, fish ▪ Complete, or high-quality proteins ▪ Plant sources ▪ Grains, legumes, and most vegetables ▪ Incomplete, or low-quality proteins 13 14 6/8/2024 8 FOOD SOURCES: PROTEIN (CONT’D) ▪ Average DRI is 46 to 56 g of protein per day for the healthy adult ▪ Protein intake should be 10% to 15% of the total daily calories ▪ May vary depending on activity level, state of health, and availability of protein food sources Slide 15 PROTEINS ▪ Protein deficiency ▪ Marasmus ▪ A form of protein energy and nutrient malnutrition ▪ Occurring chiefly in the first year of life, characterized by growth retardation and wasting of subcutaneous fat and muscle ▪ Kwashiorkor ▪ A condition occurring in infants and young children soon after weaning from breast milk 15 16 6/8/2024 9 PROTEINS (CONT’D) ▪ Protein excess ▪ Stressful to the liver and kidneys ▪ Kidneys must rid the body of excess waste products ▪ Liver function is strained with the excess load of protein to metabolize ▪ Can lead to excess fat in the diet VEGETARIAN DIETS ▪ Lacto-ovo-vegetarian ▪ Dairy products, eggs, and plant foods included in the diet ▪ Lactovegetarian ▪ Eggs are excluded; dairy products and plant foods included ▪ Vegan ▪ All animal food sources are excluded, including honey ▪ At risk of developing a protein deficiency 17 18 6/8/2024 10 VEGETARIAN DIETS (CONT’D) Well-planned vegetarian diets offer health benefits Decreased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity Vegans may have a diet deficient in Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, riboflavin, and vitamin D CARBOHYDRATES ▪ The body’s main source of energy ▪ Should make up 50% to 60% of the daily diet ▪ Supply 4 calories/g ▪ Regulate protein and fat metabolism, fight infection, and promote growth of body tissues ▪ Three main types: ▪ Simple, complex, and fiber 19 20 6/8/2024 11 CARBOHYDRATES (CONT’D) ▪ Simple carbohydrates ▪ Glucose is the metabolized form of sugar found in the body and is found in: ▪ Table sugar (sucrose), the major sweetener found in foods ▪ Fruit sugar (fructose) ▪ Milk sugar (lactose) ▪ Quickly absorbed into the bloodstream ▪ Cause a quick rise in serum glucose CARBOHYDRATES (CONT’D) ▪ Complex carbohydrates ▪ Breads, pasta, cereals, and rice ▪ Broken down into simple sugars for use by the body ▪ Provide a more consistent serum glucose level than simple sugars provide ▪ Recommended that 85% to 95% of consumed carbohydrates are complex carbohydrates 21 22 6/8/2024 12 CARBOHYDRATES (CONT’D) ▪ Fiber ▪ The portion of the carbohydrate that cannot be broken down during digestion ▪ Passes through the intestine undigested ▪ Increases bulk in the stool ▪ Aids in elimination ▪ May decrease absorption of fat ▪ Recommended intake 21 to 38 g/day FOOD SOURCES: FIBER ▪ Fruits ▪ Apples, bananas, oranges, grapefruits ▪ Cantaloupe, strawberries ▪ Vegetables ▪ Green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, celery ▪ Corn, potato (with skin), sweet potato ▪ Grains and cereals ▪ Breads, All Bran, oatmeal, Shredded Wheat ▪ Legumes (cooked) ▪ Beans: kidney, pinto, lima;
