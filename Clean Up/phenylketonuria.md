Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic disorder in which the body is unable to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is necessary for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, another amino acid. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the [[Blood]] and can lead to a variety of health problems if not managed properly.

### Key Features of Phenylketonuria (PKU):

1. **Symptoms:**
   - Intellectual disability (if untreated)
   - [[Developmental]] delays
   - Behavioral problems
   - Seizures
   - Musty odor in breath, skin, or urine due to the buildup of phenylalanine
   - Eczema
   - Fair skin and blue eyes (phenylalanine is involved in melanin production)

2. **Causes:**
   - **Genetic mutation:** PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the [[gene]] in each cell have mutations. The [[gene]] involved is called PAH, which provides instructions for making the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

3. **Diagnosis:**
   - **Newborn screening:** Most cases are detected through routine newborn screening tests. A small [[Blood]] sample is taken from the baby's heel to check phenylalanine levels.
   - **[[genetic testing]]:** Can confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific mutations in the PAH [[gene]].

4. **Treatment:**
   - **Dietary management:** The primary treatment for PKU is a strict low-phenylalanine diet. This involves avoiding high-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and some artificial sweeteners like aspartame.
   - **Phenylalanine-free medical formula:** Special medical formulas are available to provide essential nutrients without phenylalanine.
   - **Regular monitoring:** Frequent [[Blood]] tests to monitor phenylalanine levels and adjust the diet as needed.
   - **Medications:** In some cases, medications like sapropterin (Kuvan) can help lower phenylalanine levels by enhancing the activity of the deficient enzyme.

5. **Prognosis:**
   - With early and continuous treatment, individuals with PKU can lead normal, healthy lives. However, if left untreated, PKU can lead to severe and irreversible intellectual disability and other neurological problems.

### Important Considerations:
- **Lifelong management:** PKU requires lifelong dietary management and monitoring.
- **Maternal PKU:** Women with PKU must follow the dietary restrictions before and during pregnancy to prevent high phenylalanine levels from affecting the developing fetus, which can lead to birth defects and [[Developmental]] issues.

Early diagnosis and consistent treatment are crucial for preventing the serious health problems associated with PKU.
