Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a rare type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children. It is the most common type of kidney cancer in pediatric patients and typically occurs in children aged 3 to 4 years, though it can occasionally be found in older children and, very rarely, in adults.

### Key Points about Wilms Tumor:
1. **Symptoms**: 
   - **Abdominal Mass**: The most common sign of Wilms tumor is a palpable mass or swelling in the abdomen. The mass is usually painless but can sometimes cause discomfort.
   - **Other Symptoms**: Some children may experience abdominal pain, [[Fever]], [[Blood]] in the urine (hematuria), high [[Blood]] pressure (hypertension), loss of appetite, and weight loss.

2. **Diagnosis**: 
   - **Imaging Studies**: Wilms tumor is typically diagnosed through imaging studies such as [[ultrasound]], CT scans, or MRI of the abdomen to visualize the tumor.
   - **Biopsy**: In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. However, surgery to remove the tumor often serves both as treatment and as a means of confirming the diagnosis.

3. **Staging**: 
   - The tumor is staged based on the extent of the disease, including whether it is confined to the kidney, has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs such as the lungs or [[Liver]].
   - Staging helps [[Guide]] treatment and predict the prognosis.

4. **Treatment**: 
   - **Surgery**: The primary treatment is surgical removal of the affected kidney (nephrectomy). In cases where both kidneys are affected, efforts are made to preserve as much kidney tissue as possible.
   - **Chemotherapy**: Most children receive chemotherapy, either before or after surgery, depending on the stage of the tumor. Chemotherapy is often effective in shrinking the tumor and killing any remaining cancer cells.
   - **Radiation Therapy**: Radiation therapy may be used in certain cases, particularly if the tumor is large, has spread, or if there is residual cancer after surgery.

5. **Prognosis**: 
   - The prognosis for children with Wilms tumor is generally very good, especially if the tumor is detected early and treated promptly. The 5-year survival rate for localized Wilms tumor is over 90%. Even in cases where the cancer has spread, modern treatments have significantly improved outcomes.

6. **Genetic Factors**: 
   - A small percentage of Wilms tumors are associated with genetic syndromes, such as WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and intellectual disability), Denys-Drash syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Genetic counseling and testing may be recommended in these cases.

7. **Follow-Up Care**: 
   - Long-term follow-up care is important for children treated for Wilms tumor, as they may be at risk for late effects of treatment, such as reduced kidney function, secondary cancers, or other health issues.

Wilms tumor is a serious condition, but with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, many children can achieve a full recovery. If you have further questions or need more detailed information, feel free to ask!
