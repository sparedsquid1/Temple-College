### **Summary of Chapter 49: Nursing Care of Patients With Cerebrovascular Disorders**

This chapter focuses on the nursing care of patients with **cerebrovascular disorders**, including **transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, and cerebral aneurysms**. It covers **pathophysiology, etiology, risk factors, emergency interventions, diagnostic tests, treatments, and long-term effects**.

---

### **Key Concepts:**

#### **1. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**

- A **temporary** impairment of cerebral circulation, depriving the brain of oxygen and glucose.
- **Symptoms resolve**, but TIAs are a warning sign, as **15% of strokes are preceded by a TIA**.

#### **2. Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident - CVA)**

- **Causes:** Inadequate blood flow to the brain, leading to infarction (tissue death).
- **Types:**
    - **Ischemic Stroke** (caused by blood clots)
        - **Thrombotic** (clot forms in the brain)
        - **Embolic** (clot travels to the brain)
    - **Hemorrhagic Stroke** (caused by bleeding)
        - **Subarachnoid hemorrhage** (bleeding in the space around the brain)
        - **Intracerebral hemorrhage** (bleeding within the brain)

#### **3. Risk Factors**

- **Modifiable:** Hypertension, smoking, diabetes, obesity, atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, and sickle cell disease.
- **Nonmodifiable:** Age, gender, genetics, and history of stroke/heart attack.

#### **4. Stroke Warning Signs – F.A.S.T.**

- **Face drooping**
- **Arm weakness**
- **Speech difficulty**
- **Time to call 911**

#### **5. Symptoms of Stroke**

- Depend on the affected brain area.
- **Common symptoms:** One-sided weakness, paralysis, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech impairment, vision changes, confusion, dizziness, and severe headaches.

#### **6. Diagnosis**

- **CT scan** (first-line diagnostic tool)
- **MRI, blood tests, ECG, cerebral angiogram, and Doppler ultrasound**.

#### **7. Emergency & Therapeutic Interventions**

- **Thrombolytic therapy** (for ischemic strokes, within **3-4.5 hours**).
- **Airway management, blood pressure control, glucose control, and seizure prevention.**
- **Postemergent care:** Rehabilitation with **physical, occupational, and speech therapy**.
- **Medications:** Antiplatelet agents (aspirin), anticoagulants (warfarin), antihyperlipidemics (statins).

#### **8. Long-Term Stroke Effects**

- Impaired **motor function, sensation, speech, swallowing, judgment, and emotional stability**.
- **Aphasia:** Language impairment (receptive vs. expressive).
- **Unilateral neglect:** Ignoring one side of the body.

#### **9. Cerebral Aneurysm & Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**

- **Aneurysm:** A weak spot in the artery wall.
- **Symptoms:** Severe headache, nausea, photophobia, increased intracranial pressure, seizures.
- **Treatment:** Surgical **clipping, wrapping, or coiling**.

#### **10. Nursing Interventions**

- **Monitor neurological status, airway clearance, mobility, skin integrity, and nutrition.**
- **Prevent aspiration** (swallowing evaluation before oral intake).
- **Fall precautions and patient education**.
