**[[H. pylori]] eradication** refers to the medical treatment aimed at completely eliminating *[[H. pylori]]* ([[H. pylori]]) bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. [[H. pylori]] is a type of bacteria that can cause chronic inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), peptic ulcers, and is associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer.

**Eradication therapy** typically involves a combination of antibiotics and acid-suppressing medications. The most common treatment regimen is called triple therapy, which includes:

1. **Two antibiotics** (such as [[clarithromycin]] and [[amoxicillin]] or [[metronidazole]]) to kill the bacteria.
2. **A proton pump inhibitor (PPI)** (such as [[omeprazole]] or [[lansoprazole]]) to reduce stomach acid and create a less favorable environment for the bacteria, as well as to promote healing of the stomach lining.

Sometimes, a [[Bismuth]]-containing medication is added, making it a quadruple therapy. 

The goal of eradication is to relieve symptoms, prevent complications like ulcers and stomach cancer, and to avoid recurrence of infection. Testing for [[H. pylori]] is often done before and after treatment to confirm that the bacteria has been completely eliminated.
