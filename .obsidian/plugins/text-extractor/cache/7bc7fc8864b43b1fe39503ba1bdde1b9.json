The pattern is reversed when accounting for our own behavior. Blaming the victim We tend to blame the victims of misfortune for causing their own misfortune or for not taking steps to prevent or avoid it. This is partly due to the just-worid hypothesis. Hindsight bias After an event has occurred, we tend to overestimate the extent to which we could have foreseen or predicted the outcome. Self-serving bias We have a tendency to take credit for our successes by attributing them to internal, personal causes, along with a tendency to distance ourselves from our failures by attributing them to external, situational causes. The self-serving bias is more common in individualistic cultures. Self-effacing (or We tend to blame ourselves for our failures, attributing them to internal, personal causes, while downplaying modesty) bias our successes by attributing them to external, situational causes. The self-effacing bias is more common in collectivistic cultures.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
