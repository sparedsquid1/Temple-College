**Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [[Blood]] infections**, also known as **Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB)**, are serious infections where the bacteria enter the bloodstream. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at these infections:

### What is Staphylococcus aureus?
Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria commonly found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people. While it often causes no harm, it can sometimes cause infections.

### How Does It Enter the Bloodstream?
S. aureus can enter the bloodstream through:
- Skin wounds or cuts
- Surgical procedures
- Injections or intravenous drug use
- Intravascular devices like catheters or prosthetic devices

### Symptoms
Symptoms of an S. aureus [[Blood]] infection can vary but often include:
- [[Fever]] and chills
- Low [[Blood]] pressure
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion or other changes in mental status
- Pain in the area of an infection (such as a wound or surgical site)
- Fatigue and malaise

### Complications
If not treated promptly, S. aureus bacteremia can lead to severe complications, including:
- Sepsis: A life-threatening response to infection causing systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
- Endocarditis: Infection of the [[Heart]] valves.
- Osteomyelitis: Infection of the bone.
- Septic arthritis: Infection in a joint.
- Abscesses in organs or tissues.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:
- [[Blood]] cultures to detect the presence of S. aureus in the [[Blood]].
- Imaging studies (such as echocardiograms, MRIs, or CT scans) to identify potential sites of infection or complications.

### Treatment
Treatment usually requires:
- **Antibiotics**: These are selected based on the susceptibility profile of the S. aureus strain, which can include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ([[MRSA]]) or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
- **Removal of the infection source**: If a catheter or other device is the source of the infection, it may need to be removed.
- **Supportive care**: For managing symptoms and supporting organ function.

### Prevention
Preventive measures include:
- Proper hand hygiene and wound care.
- Aseptic techniques during medical procedures.
- Appropriate use and management of intravenous lines and catheters.
- Screening and decolonization strategies in healthcare settings, particularly for high-risk patients.
