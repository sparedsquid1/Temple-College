Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe, potentially life-threatening skin condition characterized by widespread skin and mucous membrane damage. It is a type of severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) that often results from an adverse reaction to medications.

### Key Features of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis:

1. **Symptoms**:
   - **Skin Lesions**: Rapid onset of large, painful blisters and peeling of the skin, similar to severe burns. The skin can slough off in sheets.
   - **Mucous Membranes**: Involvement of mucous membranes, including those in the [[Mouth]], eyes, and genital areas, leading to painful sores and ulcerations.
   - **Systemic Symptoms**: [[Fever]], malaise, and generalized weakness.

2. **Causes**:
   - **Medications**: The most common triggers are certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], including antibiotics, [[Anticonvulsants]], and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]]). Sulfonamides, [[allopurinol]], and some antiepileptic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are often implicated.
   - **Infections**: Though less common, viral infections can also be associated with TEN.

3. **Diagnosis**:
   - **Clinical Presentation**: Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination and the characteristic appearance of the skin and mucous membranes.
   - **Biopsy**: A skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis by showing full-thickness epidermal necrosis.

4. **Treatment**:
   - **Immediate Discontinuation**: The first step is to immediately stop the offending medication.
   - **Supportive Care**: Patients may require supportive care similar to burn treatment, including fluid and electrolyte management, pain control, and wound care.
   - **Hospitalization**: TEN typically requires hospitalization in a specialized unit, such as a burn unit or intensive care unit, due to the severity of the condition.

5. **Prognosis**:
   - **Mortality**: TEN has a high mortality rate, with outcomes depending on factors like the extent of skin involvement, underlying health, and promptness of treatment.
   - **Recovery**: Recovery can be prolonged, and survivors may experience long-term effects, including scarring and ocular complications.

### Prevention:
- **Medication Monitoring**: Identifying and avoiding known triggers, particularly in individuals with a history of drug reactions, can help prevent TEN.
- **[[genetic testing]]**: In some cases, [[genetic testing]] (e.g., HLA typing) may be used to identify individuals at higher risk for drug-induced severe reactions.

If TEN is suspected, immediate medical attention is crucial to manage the condition and improve outcomes.
