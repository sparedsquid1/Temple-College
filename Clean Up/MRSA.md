**Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** is a type of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that has developed resistance to many antibiotics, including methicillin and other more common antibiotics like [[oxacillin]], penicillin, and [[amoxicillin]]. This resistance makes MRSA infections more difficult to treat compared to non-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### What is Staphylococcus aureus?
Staphylococcus aureus, often referred to as "staph," is a common bacterium found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people. While it typically doesn't cause harm, it can lead to infections if it enters the body through a cut, wound, or medical procedure.

### How Does MRSA Develop?
MRSA develops when Staphylococcus aureus bacteria acquire resistance genes, often through horizontal [[gene]] transfer or mutations. The resistance primarily involves the mecA [[gene]], which encodes a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) that reduces the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics.

### Types of MRSA
1. **Healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA)**: Acquired in healthcare settings like hospitals and nursing homes. It often affects patients with weakened immune systems or those with invasive devices.
2. **Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA)**: Acquired outside of healthcare settings. It can affect healthy individuals, often presenting as skin and soft tissue infections.

### Infections Caused by MRSA
MRSA can cause a range of infections, including:
- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: Boils, abscesses, and cellulitis.
- **Bacteremia**: Bloodstream infections.
- **Endocarditis**: Infection of the [[Heart]] valves.
- **Pneumonia**: Lung infection.
- **Osteomyelitis**: Bone infection.
- **Septic arthritis**: Joint infection.

### Symptoms
Symptoms of MRSA infections depend on the site of infection but can include:
- Red, swollen, and painful skin lesions
- Pus or other drainage from the infected area
- [[Fever]] and chills
- Fatigue and malaise
- Shortness of breath (in cases of pneumonia)
- Pain in bones or joints (in cases of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis)

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:
- **Culture and sensitivity testing**: Culturing bacteria from an infection site and testing for antibiotic susceptibility.
- **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**: A rapid test to detect the presence of MRSA DNA.

### Treatment
Treatment of MRSA infections includes:
- **Antibiotics**: Options may include [[vancomycin]], [[linezolid]], [[Daptomycin]], and other MRSA-effective antibiotics.
- **Drainage**: Surgical drainage of abscesses or infected fluid collections.
- **Supportive care**: Management of symptoms and supportive treatment for complications.

### Prevention
Preventive measures include:
- **Hand hygiene**: Regular hand washing with soap and water or using [[Alcohol]]-based hand sanitizers.
- **Wound care**: Keeping cuts and scrapes clean and covered until healed.
- **Avoiding sharing personal items**: Towels, razors, and other personal items should not be shared.
- **Environmental cleaning**: Regular cleaning of surfaces in healthcare settings and at [[Home]].
- **Contact precautions**: In healthcare settings, using protective equipment and isolating infected patients to prevent the spread.

MRSA is a significant public health concern due to its resistance to multiple antibiotics and its ability to cause severe and sometimes life-threatening infections. Prompt diagnosis, effective treatment, and rigorous infection control practices are essential to managing and preventing MRSA infections.
