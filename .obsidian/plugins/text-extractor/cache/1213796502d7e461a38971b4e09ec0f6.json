Nursing Care of Women With Reproductive System Disorders Answer Section MULTIPLE CHOICE 1. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 42. Nursing Care of Women With Reproductive System Disorders Objective: Explain the pathophysiology of each of the disorders of the female reproductive system. Page: 865 Heading: Fibrocystic Breast Disease Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Fibrocystic breast disease is due to a hormonal response, primarily to estrogen. Because estrogen levels decrease after menopause, the symptoms are likely to subside at that time. 2 Limitation of dietary fats and caffeine, along with the addition of oral contraceptives may help control hormonal changes associated with the condition. 3 Fibrocystic breast disease is not related to the development of breast cancer. However, the presence of fibrous tissue in the breasts make it more difficult to diagnose breast cancer should it develop. 4 Fibrocystic disease is most common in women between the ages of 30 and 50 years.

Page: 874 Heading: Endometriosis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Teaching/Learning Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Endometriosis is considered to be retrograde menstruation because of the backward leakage of blood and tissue into the fallopian tubes and pelvic cavity. 2 The management of endometriosis is related to the management of hormones involved in menstruation. Reduction of ovulation via medications or surgical removal of the ovaries can be effective. However, the treatment results in infertility; this information can be premature to a young patient newly diagnosed with the condition. 3 The migrated endometrium cells will attach to or grow into tissues such as the intestinal walls, ovaries, and other abdominal structures/organs. 4 On a cyclic basis mediated by ovarian hormones, the endometrial cells in the abdomen will buildup and slough like those in the uterus. The difference is that the bleeding occurs within the abdominal cavity, causing pain, swelling, and damage to abdominal organs and structures. The scar tissue will result in infertility.

A. Davis Company Feedback 1 To prevent conception, the patient needs to continue to practice birth control until she receives confirmation from her health care provider (HCP) that menopause is complete. 2 A tubal ligation is not necessary because only a brief time of needing protection remains. 3 Six months is not a magic number; menopause needs to be confirmed by an HCP. 4 It is important to remind perimenopausal women that they may still be fertile even after several months of amenorrhea. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 5. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 42. Nursing Care of Women With Reproductive System Disorders Objective: Describe the etiologies, signs, and symptoms of each disorder. Page: 881 Heading: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient is exhibiting and reporting the classic manifestations of PCOS. 2 With PCOS, many symptoms are a result of insulin resistance with excessive levels of insulin in the blood, which in turn stimulates the secretion of androgens. 3 Severe endometriosis does not exhibit the listed manifestations and is not related to PCOS. 4 PCOS is not related to immature ovaries.

Page: 879 Heading: Displacement Disorders Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 It is important for a patient with displacement disorders to maintain a healthy Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company weight because obesity will worsen the condition. However, there is another consideration that is more important. 2 Constipation can increase the manifestations of displacement disorders; however, another nursing action is more important. 3 The most important action by the nurse for a patient with displacement disorders is to discuss the importance and performance of Kegel exercises, which keep the pubococcygeus muscles strong and able to support pelvic organs. 4 With a pessary, the patient needs to report pink, bloody, or purulent drainage from the vagina to the HCP. This is important if it occurs. Kegel exercises are more important because they address an existing condition. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 7. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 42.

Page: 884 Heading: Natural Family Planning Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Teaching/Learning Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The method described is incorrect to measure basal body temperature. 2 The method described is incorrect to measure basal body temperature. 3 The method described is incorrect to measure basal body temperature. 4 The nurse teaches the patient to keep a precise record of her oral temperatures with a basal thermometer each morning on awakening, before any other activity. The first day of her menses is day 1 on the temperature chart. Changing levels of hormones result in slight temperature changes, which can be used to identify when ovulation seems to be occurring and when particular hormone levels should be tested.

A. Davis Company Feedback 1 Perforation of the vaginal wall with an IUD rarely occurs. 2 The effectiveness of an IUD is between 5 to 10 years, depending on the specific product. 3 It is best to insert an IUD during the first 7 days of menses because the cervix is slightly open at this time. 4 The procedure is commonly performed in the HCP’s office.

Page: 885 Heading: Barrier Methods Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 It is true that a diaphragm is more expensive and may need to be refitted and replaced for a variety of reasons. However, this does not address effectiveness. 2 Male condoms can be applied as part of sexual foreplay; however, this does not address effectiveness. 3 The addition of spermicide with the use of any barrier contraception device improves the effectiveness. 4 There is no evidence that female condoms are more effective; they are more expensive and may break or be defective.

Page: 886 Heading: Sterilization Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Teaching/Learning Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Removal of the uterus is a hysterectomy; there are effective methods of sterilization that are less invasive and with fewer possible complications. 2 The male partner of the patient can opt for a vasectomy; however, this statement Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company does not specifically address the patient’s wishes. 3 A nonsurgical procedure (Essure) uses an endoscope to place tiny implants into each fallopian tube to block tube patency. The procedure can be performed at any time. 4 There is no indication that the procedure is best performed after child birth unless the patient delivers via cesarean.

The information can be emotionally devastating and cause intense feelings. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 3 There is no indication that the patient has experienced surgery. 4 The patient will need privacy to deal with emotions and the meaning of the diagnosis.

Page: 874 Heading: Hormone Replacement Therapy Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 To be effective, calcium and vitamin D therapy should begin in early adulthood. This suggestion is likely to be ineffective. 2 Increasing weight-bearing exercise and activity is appropriate to promote bone health, which is no longer protected by estrogen. 3 Phytoestrogens can provide the benefits of estrogen without hormone replacement therapy. However, phytoestrogens do carry some risks; food and supplement additions should be discussed with the HCP. 4 The suggestion to dress in layers so that clothing can be removed easily during hot flashes is an effective intervention during menopause.
