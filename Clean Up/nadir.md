In medical terms, "nadir" refers to the lowest point of something, often used to describe the lowest point of [[Blood]] cell counts following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. For instance, after a chemotherapy session, a patient's white [[Blood]] cell count might reach its nadir before it starts to recover. Monitoring the nadir is important because it helps healthcare providers manage potential complications and adjust treatment plans accordingly.
