The Guaiac test, also known as the Hemoccult test or Fecal Occult [[Blood]] Test (FOBT), is a medical screening test used to detect hidden [[Blood]] in stool samples. It's commonly used to screen for colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal conditions.

Here's how it works:

1. A small sample of stool is collected from the patient.
2. The sample is then mixed with a chemical called guaiac, which reacts with hemoglobin (a protein found in red [[Blood]] cells) to produce a blue color if there is [[Blood]] present.
3. If the test result is positive, it indicates that there is occult (hidden) [[Blood]] in the stool.

The Guaiac test is often used as a screening tool because it's relatively inexpensive and easy to perform. However, it has some limitations:

- It may not detect [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] types of gastrointestinal bleeding or cancer.
- False positives can occur due to factors like diet, medications, or other medical conditions.
- The test requires a stool sample, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

In recent years, more sensitive and specific tests have been developed, such as fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and multi-target stool DNA testing (MT-sDNA). These tests can detect [[Blood]] and genetic markers of cancer in the stool, providing a more accurate diagnosis.
