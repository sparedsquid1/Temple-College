Angioedema is a medical condition characterized by the rapid swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. This swelling often occurs in areas such as the face, lips, throat, and around the eyes, but it can also affect the extremities, genitalia, and internal organs. Angioedema can be acute or chronic and can result from various causes:

1. **Allergic Reactions**: Triggered by allergens such as foods, medications, insect stings, or latex.
2. **Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)**: A genetic disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor, a protein that regulates immune system activity.
3. **Idiopathic Angioedema**: The cause is unknown, but it might be linked to certain triggers like stress or infections.
4. **Drug-Induced**: Commonly associated with medications like ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat high [[Blood]] pressure.
5. **Acquired Angioedema**: Can be associated with certain medical conditions like lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune diseases.

Symptoms of angioedema include:

- Sudden swelling of the skin and mucous membranes
- Pain or tenderness in the swollen areas
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing if the throat is affected
- Abdominal pain if the gastrointestinal tract is involved

Angioedema can be life-threatening if it causes significant swelling in the throat, leading to airway obstruction. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition and may include:

- Antihistamines for allergic reactions
- [[Corticosteroids]] to reduce inflammation
- [[Epinephrine]] for severe, life-threatening reactions
- C1 inhibitor concentrates or bradykinin receptor antagonists for hereditary angioedema
- Discontinuation of offending medications in drug-induced cases

Management may also involve avoiding known triggers and carrying emergency medications for those at risk of severe reactions.
