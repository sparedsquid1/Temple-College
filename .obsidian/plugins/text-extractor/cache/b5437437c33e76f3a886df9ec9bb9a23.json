Social Psychology is a branch of psychology that investigates how a person’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior are influenced by the presence of other people and by the social and physical environment. The social situations can include being alone, in the presence of others, or in front of a crowd of onlookers. “A number of psychologists have been leaders in addressing the importance of culture, race, and ethnicity. Hector Betancourt and Steven Regeser Lopez (1993) wrote a groundbreaking article, The Study of Culture, Ethnicity, and Race in American Psychology, that emphasized the need to understand how these factors affect people from marginalized groups, and people from majority groups, too. They argued that a full understanding of psychology requires attention to culture, ethnicity, and race, and that research in these areas should not be “segregated from mainstream psychology.” A few years later, Stanley Sue (1999) argued that psychological science did not place sufficient value on research with members of racial and ethnic minority groups.” (Nolan & Hockenbury, 2022, p. 400) Sense of self – Social Influence focuses on the effect of situational factors and other people on an individual’s behavior. Person perception refers to the mental processes used to form judgments and draw conclusions about the characteristics and motives of other people. (subjective) Once we form impressions of people, we tend to interpret their behavior in terms of our attitudes about them. Social norms – Social Psychology Page 2 Social categorization is the mental process of classifying people into groups on the basis of common characteristics. What Is Beautiful Is Good We are culturally conditioned to associate beauty with goodness and evil with ugliness — an implicit personality theory that has been dubbed the “what is beautiful is good” myth (Sheppard et al., 2011). For example, in the Marvel Universe, it’s often easy to distinguish between the heroes and the villains. Here, the brightly dressed Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan) with her beautifully inked dark hair is a force of good — not to mention that she is the first Muslim superhero in the Marvel Universe to appear on the big screen. And Ultron’s intimidating animation and coloring suggest that he is a force of chaos and evil. Attribution is the mental process of inferring the cause of someone’s behavior, including one’s own. Psychologists also use the word attribution to refer to the explanation you make for a particular behavior. The attributions you make strongly influence your thoughts and feelings about other people. Fundamental attribution error is the tendency to attribute the behavior of others to internal, personal characteristics, while ignoring or underestimating the role of external, situational factors (Ross, 1977). Social Psychology Page 3 Attitudes. Psychologists formally define an attitude as a learned tendency to evaluate some object, person, or issue in a particular way. Attitudes are typically positive or negative and have three components. Prejudice Prejudice refers to a negative attitude toward people who belong to a specific social group, while stereotypes are clusters of characteristics that are attributed to people who belong to specific social categories. Prejudice is ultimately based on the exaggerated notion that members of other social groups are very different from members of our own social group. First, people from different groups, such as from different racial and ethnic groups, are far more alike than they are different (Mallett & Wilson, 2010; Wagner et al., 2011). Second, any differences that may exist between members of different groups are far smaller than differences among various members of the same group (Bondenhausen & Richeson & Richeson, 2010). It also is important to observe that conversations about prejudice often focus on race and ethnicity. But prejudice can occur with respect to many different kinds of social groups, and can vary across cultures (Fisk, 2017). There can be prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or age. There can also be prejudice based on a person’s identification with multiple groups, a phenomenon that is often referred to as intersectionality (Bowleg, 2017; Hester et al., 2020; Kang & Bodenhausen, 2015). Social Psychology Page 4 Intersectionality refers to the ways in which a person’s different group identities combine to influence their experience in the world, including prejudice and discrimination. For example, Amanda Gorman, the 22-year-old poet who performed her work at the 2021 U.S. presidential inauguration, talked about her experiences balancing coursework, activism, and her duties as the first U.S. National Youth Poet Laureate: “I’m navigating all that while also being a young Black woman navigating the intersectionality of my identity” (Hawgood, 2017). Ingroup bias is the tendency to judge the behavior of our ingroup members favorably and outgroup members unfavorably. We succeeded because we worked hard; they succeeded because they lucked out. We failed because of circumstances beyond our control; they failed because they’re stupid and incompetent. We’re thrifty; they’re stingy. And so on. In contrast to explicit attitudes, of which you are consciously aware, implicit attitudes are preferences and biases toward particular groups that are automatic, spontaneous, unintentional, and often unconscious (Bohner & Dickel, 2011). They are sometimes, but not always, unconscious (Sritharan & Gawronski, 2010). Our implicit attitudes often differ from our explicit attitudes, especially when social and cultural norms prohibit negative attitudes regarding race, gender, or sexual orientation (Bondenhausen & Richeson, 2010). If people won’t admit or aren’t consciously aware of implicit attitudes, how can they be detected and measured? The most widely used test to measure implicit attitudes and preferences is the Implicit Association Test, or IAT, developed by psychologist Anthony Greenwald and his colleagues (1998). It also is important to recognize that discrimination grows not only out of individual prejudice, but also out of longstanding and entrenched cultural and institutional structures (Salter et al., 2018). Psychological interventions must target legal, health, educational, and other structures as well as prejudice at the individual level. Conformity Conformity refers to adjusting opinions, judgments, or behaviors so that they match those of other people, or the norms of a social group or situation. The critical question of “How far will we go to adjust our perceptions and opinions to the majority?” was discussed in the work of Solomon Asch, who studied conformity. Solomon Asch Study – Factors influencing Conformity Normative social influence – behavior motivated by the desire to gain social acceptance and approval. Informational social influence – behavior motivated by the desire to be correct. Social Psychology Page 5 Factors that promote conformity Individualistic cultures tend to emphasize independence, self-expression, and standing out from the crowd, the whole notion of conformity tends to carry a negative connotation. Collectivistic cultures, however, publicly conforming while privately disagreeing tends to be regarded as socially appropriate tact or sensitivity. Publicly challenging the judgments of others, particularly the judgment of members of one’s ingroup, would be considered rude, tactless, and insensitive to the feelings of others. Obedience Obedience is the performance of a behavior in response to a direct command. Typically, an authority figure or a person of higher status, such as a teacher or supervisor, gives the command. Milgram’s Obedience Experiment – Being at odds with the majority or with authority figures is uncomfortable for most people — enough so that our judgment and perceptions can be distorted and we may act in ways that violate our conscience. TABLE 12.1 Factors That Promote Conformity You’re more likely to conform to group norms when: • You are facing a unanimous group of at least four or five people • You must give your response in front of the group • You have not already expressed commitment to a different idea or opinion • You find the task to be ambiguous or difficult • You doubt your abilities or knowledge in the situation • You are strongly attracted to a group and want to be a member of it Social Psychology Page 6 Finally, we need to emphasize that conformity and obedience are not completely bad in and of themselves. Quite the contrary. Conformity and obedience are necessary for an orderly society, which is why such behaviors were instilled in all of us as children. The critical issue is not so much whether people conform or obey, because we all do so every day of our lives. Rather, the critical issue is whether the norms we conform to, or the orders we obey, reflect values that respect the rights, well-being, and dignity of others. Altruism Altruism refers to helping another person with no expectation of personal benefit. An altruistic act is fundamentally selfless — the individual is motivated purely by the desire to help someone in need. Factors that increase the likelihood of bystanders helping. • Personality factors • The feel good, do good effect. TABLE 12.3 Resisting an Authority’s Unacceptable Orders • Verify your own discomfort by asking yourself, “Is this something I would do if I were controlling the situation?” • Express your discomfort. It can be as simple as saying, “I’m really not comfortable with this.” • Resist even slightly objectionable commands so that the situation doesn’t escalate into increasingly immoral or destructive obedience. • If you realize you’ve already done something unacceptable, stop at that point rather than continuing to comply. • Find or create an excuse to get out of the situation and validate your concerns with someone who is not involved with the situation. • Question the legitimacy of the authority. Most authorities have legitimacy only in specific situations. If authorities are out of their legitimate context, they have no more authority in the situation than you do. • If it is a group situation, find an ally who also feels uncomfortable with the authority’s orders. Two people expressing dissent in harmony can effectively resist conforming to the group’s actions. Social Psychology Page 7 • Feeling guilty • Seeing others who are willing to help. • Perceiving the other person as deserving help. • Knowing how to help. • A personalized relationship. • A dangerous situation. What decreases the likelihood that people will help? The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which the greater the number of people present, the less likely each individual is to help someone in distress. • Diffusion of responsibility – • Normative social influence – we are motivated to some extent by the desire to behave in a socially acceptable way. • Being in a big city or a very small town. • Vague or ambiguous situations. • When personal costs for helping outweigh the benefits. What would you do? 1. You are in a moderately crowded swimming pool and you see someone under water, close to the side of the pool, who has not moved for a minute or so. Would you help? Why or why not? What assistance would you provide? 2. You are driving down the road and see a very old woman struggling to change a flat tire on her car. Would you help? Why or why not? What assistance would you provide? 3. You are about to enter a convenience store when you see someone holding a knife on the clerk. Would you help? Why or why not? What assistance would you provide?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
