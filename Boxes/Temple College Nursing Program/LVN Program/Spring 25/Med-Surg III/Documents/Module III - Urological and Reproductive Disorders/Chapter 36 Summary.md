### **Summary of Chapter 36: Urinary System Function, Assessment, and Therapeutic Measures**

#### **1. Urinary System Anatomy and Physiology**

- **Organs:** Two kidneys, two ureters, bladder, and [[Urethra]].
- **Kidney Functions:**
    - Urine formation.
    - Water conservation or excretion.
    - Electrolyte and acid-base balance.
    - Vitamin D activation.
    - Erythropoietin and renin production.
- **[[Glomerular filtration rate]] ([[Glomerular filtration rate]]):** 100-125 mL/minute.

#### **2. Urinary System Structures**

- **Ureters:** Transport urine to the bladder.
- **Bladder:** Stores urine before elimination.
- **[[Urethra]]:** Excretes urine from the bladder.

#### **3. Normal Urine Characteristics**

- **Volume:** 1,000-2,000 mL/day.
- **Color:** Pale yellow to amber.
- **pH:** 4.5-8.0.
- **Specific gravity:** 1.005-1.030.
- **Composition:** 95% water, urea, creatinine, uric acid.

#### **4. Effects of Aging on the Urinary System**

- Reduced kidney size and renal [[flow]].
- Decreased bladder capacity and voiding reflex.

#### **5. Nursing Assessment**

- **Symptoms:** Flank pain, burning urination, edema, shortness of breath.
- **Vital signs:** High BP may indicate kidney disease.
- **Physical Exam:** Check for lung crackles, edema, skin changes (uremic frost).
- **[[Lab]] Tests:**
    - **Urinalysis:** Checks infection, kidney function.
    - **Renal Function Tests:** Creatinine, [[Blood]] urea nitrogen ([[BUN]]), uric acid.
    - **24-hour urine collection:** Measures creatinine clearance.
    - **Urine culture:** Identifies bacterial infection.
    - **Contrast-Induced Nephropathy:** Contrast media may cause kidney injury, especially in high-risk patients.

#### **6. Diagnostic and Imaging Procedures**

- **Renal Biopsy:** Identifies kidney disease; contraindicated in bleeding disorders.
- **X-rays, Pyelogram (IV, Retrograde, Antegrade), [[ultrasound]]:** Evaluate kidney structure and function.
- **Renal Angiography:** Uses contrast dye to visualize renal arteries.
- **Cystoscopy and Pyelogram:** Endoscopic examination of bladder and ureters.

#### **7. Urinary Disorders and Management**

- **Urinary Incontinence:**
    - **Types:** Stress, urge, functional, overflow, and total incontinence.
    - **Treatment:** Lifestyle modifications, pelvic exercises, medications.
- **Urinary Retention:** May be caused by anesthesia, medications, or prostate enlargement.
- **Urinary Catheterization:**
    - **Types:** Indwelling, intermittent (preferred), and suprapubic.
    - **Risks:** Infection is a major concern.

C. Store the urine at room temperature.  
D. End the collection period by discarding the last urine sample.

**Answer:** A. Discard the first urine sample and then collect all urine for 24 hours.

A. Keeping the drainage bag above bladder level  
B. Using a closed drainage system  
C. Changing the catheter every 24 hours

---

#### **6. A nurse is preparing a patient for a renal biopsy. What pre-procedure care is appropriate?**

A. Encourage fluids  
B. Ensure the patient is NPO  
C. Administer a diuretic  
D. Position the patient in the Trendelenburg position

**Answer:** B. Ensure the patient is NPO  
**Rationale:** Patients must be NPO to reduce the risk of bleeding.

---

#### **7. A patient with chronic kidney disease is at risk for which electrolyte imbalance?**

A. Hypokalemia  
B. Hyperkalemia  
C. Hypercalcemia  
D. Hypophosphatemia

**Answer:** B. Hyperkalemia  
**Rationale:** Impaired kidney function leads to potassium retention.

---

#### **8. A patient is experiencing stress incontinence. What is an appropriate nursing intervention?**

A. Administer a diuretic  
B. Teach Kegel exercises  
C. Recommend fluid restriction  
D. Encourage prolonged voiding intervals

**Answer:** B. Teach Kegel exercises

A. Routinely flushing the catheter with sterile water  
B. Replacing the catheter every 48 hours

A. Encourage early ambulation  
B. Monitor for signs of bleeding  
C. Encourage a high-protein diet  
D. Administer IV fluids to prevent dehydration

**Answer:** **B. Monitor for signs of bleeding**

A. "I will increase my fluid intake before bedtime."  
B. "I will practice Kegel exercises daily."  
C. "I should avoid going to the bathroom too often."  
D. "I will limit physical activity to prevent leakage."

**Answer:** **B. "I will practice Kegel exercises daily."**  
**Rationale:** Kegel exercises strengthen pelvic muscles and reduce stress incontinence episodes.

---

A. pH of 6.0  
B. Presence of ketones  
C. Specific gravity of 1.015  
D. Pale yellow urine color

**Answer:** **B. Presence of ketones**  
**Rationale:** Ketones in the urine may indicate diabetes, starvation, or metabolic disorders and require further evaluation.

---

A. Insert an indwelling catheter  
B. Teach double voiding technique  
C. Restrict fluid intake  
D. Increase sodium intake

**Answer:** **B. Teach double voiding technique**  
**Rationale:** Double voiding (urinating, then attempting again after a few minutes) helps empty the bladder more effectively.
