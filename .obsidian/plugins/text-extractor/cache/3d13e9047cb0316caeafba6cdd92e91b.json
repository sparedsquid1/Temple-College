The article’s author was Patricia C. Dykes. The article was published in the peer-reviewed journal of Nursing Management in the March 2021 edition. It is important to read and review and use evidence-based articles when making nursing decisions in clinical practice because it provides guidelines and tools to increase patient safety, reducing risk of injury and provides additional evidentiary facts to use in educating patient, their support system, and fellow healthcare workers. The article I reviewed explained that falls are a highly preventable occurrence in clinical settings. The author also explained the nearly 30% of falls result in injury and 90% of all falls are preventable. The author also shared that research has led to the creation of the Fall TIPS tool kit to create individualized interventions to prevent patient falls. The article taught me the importance of using a three-step process to create an individualized fall prevention plan and not just label someone as a high, medium, or low fall risk. I believe the article’s focus on fall prevention can be applied in the clinical setting. For example, in the clinical setting, a nurse can apply the information by utilizing the Fall TIPS tool kit and create an individual intervention plan. Another application example gained from the article is to applied it when educating patient and their support system about their individual fall risks in the clinical setting will lead to a reduced risk of falling at home.
