Xerostomia, or dry [[Mouth]], is a condition where the [[Salivary glands]] don’t produce enough saliva to keep the [[Mouth]] moist. This can lead to discomfort, difficulty swallowing, and an increased risk of dental issues. Xerostomia can be caused by various factors, including medications, radiation therapy, autoimmune diseases, or dehydration.

To manage xerostomia, consider these tips:
- Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
- Use saliva substitutes or [[Mouth]] moisturizers.
- Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free candies to stimulate saliva production.
- Maintain good oral hygiene and visit your dentist regularly.
- Avoid [[caffeine]], [[Alcohol]], and tobacco, as they can dry out the [[Mouth]].

If xerostomia is affecting your quality of life, it’s a good idea to discuss it with your healthcare provider for tailored advice and treatment options.
