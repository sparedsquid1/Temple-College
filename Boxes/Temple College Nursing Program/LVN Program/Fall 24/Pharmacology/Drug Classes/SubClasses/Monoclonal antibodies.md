### Adverse Reactions Immune Blockers
**[[CNS]] Reactions**
- Headache
- Dizziness 

**GI System Reactions** 
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain Immune 

**System Reactions**
- Infection, skin eruptions 
- Upper [[Respiratory]] infection (URI) with cough 
- Antibody development 

**Infusion Reactions**
Many mAbs are administered intravenously (IV) or by subcutaneous injection. During IV infusion a hypersensitive reaction may occur. This is due to the sensitivity of the client to the tissue of origin of the mAb. Mouse and human tissues are used to make the [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]. When mAbs are composed of more mouse tissue than human tissue, a hypersensitive reaction is more likely to be experienced. Also, infusion-related reactions are more likely to occur during the first infusion than in subsequent treatments. Table 49.1 lists the adverse reactions potentially seen in an infusion reaction. Table 49.1 Components of Infusion Reactions Body System Adverse Reactions Generalized [[Fever]], chills, rigors, sweating, warm feeling Cardiovascular Chest pain, palpitations, hypo-/hypertension, tachy-/bradycardia, arrhythmia, edema, [[ischemia]], infarction, cardiac arrest [[CNS]] Throbbing headache, dizziness, confusion, LOC Integumentary Rash, pruritis, [[urticaria]], erythema, tearing, [[angioedema]] GI Nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, diarrhea, abdominal cramps/bloating GU Incontinence, uterine cramping, renal impairment Multiple sclerosis [[Arthralgias]], [[myalgia]], fatigue, tumor pain, hypotonia [[Respiratory]] Cough, dyspnea, nasal congestion, [[rhinitis]], sneezing, hoarseness, tachypnea, wheezing, tightness, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, stridor, cyanosis, acute [[Respiratory]] distress syndrome

### Contraindications Immune Blockers
 mAbs should not be used if a person has an active, severe infection. Live vaccine should not be given directly before, during, or immediately after mAb use. Viral infections, such as [[hepatitis]] B may be reactivated during therapy, and antiviral treatment should be initiated. Monitor for adverse reactions in clients with cardiac and renal impairment (hypertension and proteinuria). Observe for GI distress, change in bowel habits, and progress to colitis and possible bowel perforation. mAbs can cross the [[placenta]] and cause fetal harm; therefore, women are cautioned to use effective birth control and should not use the drug when pregnant. Lactation is discouraged during and 6 months after ending mAb treatment.

### Adverse Reactions Immune Modulating Therapies
These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] tend to have less adverse reactions than [[Traditional Chemotherapy]] because they do not interfere with healthy cells. Integumentary adverse reactions can range from rash to [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. 

Infusion reactions may appear as a hypersensitive reaction; this is due to the sensitivity of the client to the tissue of origin of the mAb. mAbs composed of more human tissue than nonhuman are less likely to have a reaction than those mAbs with more mouse tissue. Fatal infusion-related reactions are more likely to occur during the first infusion than in subsequent treatments. [[Table 51.1]] lists the adverse reactions potentially seen in an infusion reaction.

### Contraindications Immune Modulating Therapies
Monoclonal antibodies should not be used if a person has an active, severe infection. Live vaccine should not be given directly before, during, or immediately after mAbs. Viral infections, such as [[hepatitis]] B may be reactivated during therapy, and antiviral treatment should be initiated. Clients being treated for non-Hodgkin [[Lymphoma]] with high tumor burden (volume) should prophylactically be treated for the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, [[Hyperuricemia]], and [[hyperphosphatemia]]). Monitor for adverse reactions in clients with cardiac and renal impairment. mAbs can cross the [[placenta]] and cause fetal harm; therefore, women are cautioned to use effective birth control and should not use the drug when pregnant. Lactation is discouraged during and 6 months after ending mAbs treatment. 

Owing to the manner in which monoclonal antibodies are named, they can be confused with each other easily. Be mindful to check the name carefully. [[Box 51.1]] discusses the methodology used in naming the [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]; this can be helpful in drug recognition.
