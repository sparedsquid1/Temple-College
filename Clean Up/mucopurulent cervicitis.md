Mucopurulent Cervicitis 

Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is an inflammation of the cervix characterized by the presence of a thick, mucopurulent (pus-like) discharge. 

Causes: 
MPC is typically caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as:
Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Other unknown bacteria. 

Symptoms:
Mucopurulent discharge from the cervix, Cervical tenderness, Dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), Vaginal bleeding after sex, and Pelvic pain (in some cases).


Diagnosis:
- Physical examination: The doctor will examine the cervix and may find a mucopurulent discharge.
- Vaginal swab: A swab is taken from the vagina to test for STIs. 

Treatment:
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. For STIs, antibiotics are typically prescribed. For example, chlamydia and gonorrhea are usually treated with a single dose of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.
  
Prevention:
Practice safe sex by using condoms, Get tested for STIs regularly, and Treat any STIs promptly.

Note:
MPC is not always caused by an STI. Other possible causes include allergic reactions, vaginitis, and cervical cancer. If you have symptoms of MPC, it is important to see a doctor to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.
