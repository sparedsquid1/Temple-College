Atrophic vaginitis, also known as genitourinary syndrome of [[menopause]] (GSM), is a condition characterized by the thinning, drying, and inflammation of the vaginal walls due to a decrease in [[estrogen]] levels. It commonly occurs in postmenopausal women but can also affect women during breastfeeding, those who have had their ovaries removed, or those undergoing treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

### Symptoms
- Vaginal dryness
- Itching or burning sensation in the [[Vagina]]
- Pain during intercourse ([[Dyspareunia]])
- Vaginal discharge
- Urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, or infections

### Causes
The primary cause of atrophic vaginitis is the decrease in [[estrogen]] levels, which leads to changes in the vaginal and urinary tract tissues.

### Treatment
Treatment options often focus on relieving symptoms and may include:
- Topical [[estrogen]] therapy (creams, rings, or tablets)
- Vaginal moisturizers and lubricants
- Systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
- Lifestyle changes such as avoiding irritants (harsh soaps, douches)

Managing atrophic vaginitis is important to improve quality of life and prevent complications like recurrent urinary tract infections.
