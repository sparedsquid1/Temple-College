Rhinitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose, leading to symptoms such as a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching. There are several types of rhinitis, categorized based on their causes:

1. **Allergic Rhinitis**: Triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold. Symptoms can be seasonal (hay [[Fever]]) or perennial (year-round).

2. **Non-Allergic Rhinitis**: Caused by factors other than allergens, such as irritants (smoke, pollution), changes in weather, infections, certain medications, or underlying health conditions. This includes:
   - **Vasomotor Rhinitis**: Triggered by environmental factors like changes in temperature, humidity, or strong odors.
   - **Infectious Rhinitis**: Usually caused by viral infections such as the common cold.
   - **Occupational Rhinitis**: Caused by exposure to irritants in the workplace.

3. **Mixed Rhinitis**: A combination of allergic and non-allergic triggers.

Diagnosis of rhinitis typically involves a clinical examination, patient history, and possibly allergy testing or nasal endoscopy. Treatment depends on the type and cause of rhinitis and may include antihistamines, decongestants, nasal [[Corticosteroids]], or avoiding known triggers. In some cases, immunotherapy (allergy shots) may be recommended for allergic rhinitis.
