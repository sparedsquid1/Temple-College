The drug is supplied in 250 mg tablets. How many tablets will the nurse administer? 500 mg x 1 tablet = X 250 mg 2 x 1 tablet = 2 tablets Practice +The health care provider orders Thorazine 20 mg po Q4h. The drug is available in 120 mL bottles of Thorazine syrup containing 10 mg/5mL. How many milliliters will the nurse administer? 20 mg x 5 mL = X 10 mg 2 x 5 mL = 10mL 9 10 8/8/2024 6 Practice with Converting Measures kg g mg mcg +A health care provider ordered Amoxicillin 0.5 g po four times a day. The drug is supplied in 500 mg capsules. How many capsules would the nurse administer? +0.5 g become 500 mg 500 mg x 1 capsule = X 500 mg 1 x 1 capsule = 1 capsule Proportion Method +If one chicken can lay 3 eggs, how many chickens do you need in order to have 51 eggs? 1 chicken = X(chicken) Then cross multiply 3 eggs 51 eggs 3x = 51 (divide by 3 on both sides to isolate the x) 3 3 X = 17 chickens 11 12 8/8/2024 7 Proportion Method +The health care provider orders NS 300 mL to infuse over 20 minutes.
