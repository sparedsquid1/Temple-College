A nurse is assessing a client and notes the client has developed swelling of the eyelids and lips after administration of a prescribed medication. What does the nurse interpret this finding to specifically indicate? A) Mild allergic reaction B) Anaphylactic shock C) Angioedema D) Drug idiosyncrasy Answer: C Rationale: Angioedema is a type of allergic drug reaction manifested by the collection of fluid in the subcutaneous tissues, most commonly affecting the eyelids, lips, mouth, and throat. Allergic reactions can be manifested by a wide range of signs and symptoms such as itching, rashes, and hives. Anaphylactic shock is a serious allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention. Drug idiosyncrasy describes any unusual or abnormal reaction to a drug, one that is different from the one normally expected.

The nurse is preparing to teach a client about a new drug which is in the fourth phase of development. Which activity will the nurse explain best illustrates this phase? A) Health care providers report adverse effects to FDA. B) Healthy volunteers are involved in the test. C) In vitro tests are performed using human cells. D) The drug is given to clients with the disease. Answer: A Rationale: The postmarketing surveillance phase of drug development encourages health care professionals to report adverse effects of drugs to the FDA using MedWatch. Phase 1 of clinical testing involves 20 to 100 healthy volunteers. In vitro testing of the drug on human or animal cells is done in the pre-FDA phase. In Phase 2 of clinical testing, the drug is given to clients with the disease for which the drug is manufactured.

A client arrives at the health care clinic and reports taking several pills for a headache and severe cough without relief. Which adverse effect should the nurse be aware may develop from this combination? A) Gastrointestinal bleeding B) Breathing difficulties C) Liver damage D) Anaphylaxis Answer: C Rationale: Consumers should be urged to carefully read the directions before taking over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, as these drugs are not without risks. For example, acetaminophen, commonly used for pain relief, is also found in many OTC products, such as cough and cold remedies. When taken for both pain and in a cold remedy, this accumulative amount of the drug can potentially harm a person's liver. Aspirin presents the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal bleeding. An allergic reaction could result in breathing difficulties and anaphylaxis.

The nurse notes on assessment after administration of a drug that the client has developed itching and a skin rash. The nurse interprets these findings as indicating which possible reaction? A) Toxicity B) Allergic reaction C) Angioedema D) Crystalluria Answer: B Rationale: Allergic reactions are manifested by a variety of signs and symptoms including itching, skin rashes, and hives. Swollen eyelids, lips, and mouth are some of the symptoms of angioedema, an allergic drug reaction that may block the airway, causing asphyxia. Toxicity or toxic reactions are caused when blood concentration levels exceed the therapeutic level of drugs. Reduced blood pressure is called hypotension. Crystals in the urine are symptoms of crystalluria.

The nurse is monitoring a client with heart failure for effectiveness of the digoxin therapy. Which factor should the nurse closely monitor for potential signs of toxicity? A) Seizure activity B) Drug blood level C) Urinary output D) Blood pressure Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should monitor the client's blood level of the drug to ensure that the level remains within the therapeutic range. Monitoring seizure activity, urination frequency, and blood pressure will not prevent toxicity. Seizure activity is unrelated to digoxin or heart failure. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 1 Learning Objective: 9 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 14, Toxic Reactions 9. The nurse is assessing a client's response to sleeping pills and notes continued restlessness and inability to sleep. After an increased dose leads to sleep, which factor should the nurse investigate first? A) Is this related to a genetic deficiency? B) Is the drug accumulating in the client's body? C) Is the client now tolerant to the drug? D) Is this a toxic reaction? Answer: C Rationale: The client has developed drug tolerance and has to be administered an increased dosage of the drug to achieve the desired effect. Cumulative drug effect occurs when the body is unable to metabolize and excrete one (normal) dose of a drug before the next dose is given. Drug idiosyncrasy is a term used to describe any unusual or abnormal reaction to a drug, which can be related to genetics. Toxic reactions are caused when blood concentration levels exceed the therapeutic levels of a drug.

An unconscious client is brought to the emergency department via ambulance after family members were unable to wake up the client after coming home drunk and taking a sleeping pill. The nurse will explain to the family that the client is most likely experiencing which type of drug reaction? A) Additive B) Synergistic C) Antagonistic D) Toxic Answer: B Rationale: A synergistic drug reaction occurs when drugs interact with each other and produce a sum greater than the sum of their separate actions. An additive drug reaction occurs when the combined effect of two drugs is equal to the sum of each drug given alone. An antagonistic drug reaction occurs when one drug interferes with the action of another, causing neutralization or a decrease in the effect of one drug. Toxic drug reactions are caused when blood concentration levels exceed the therapeutic levels of a drug.

A client is considering using herbal supplements and asks the nurse about them. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “Herbal supplements are safe to use because they are regulated closely.” B) “Herbal supplements can affect the way other medications will act.” C) “Taking more than the recommended amount usually is not harmful because they are natural.” D) “The risk of the supplement interacting with any prescription medications is extremely low.” Answer: B Rationale: The nurse needs to explain to the client that just because an herbal supplement is labeled “natural” does not mean the supplement is safe or without harmful effects. Herbal supplements can act the same way as drugs and can cause medical problems if not used correctly or if taken in large amounts. Herbal supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so products lack standardization in relation to purity and potency. In addition, the client should be warned not to take more than the recommended dose of any herbal health product or supplement. The problems that these products can cause are much more likely to occur if the client takes too much or takes them for too long.

After a discussion about the half-life of a drug, a nursing instructor concludes further teaching is necessary when nursing students choose which facts as true? Select all that apply: A) It can be decreased in clients with renal disease. B) It can help determine dosing frequency. C) It does not change throughout a client's life. D) Liver disease can increase. E) It is the measure of the rate at which drugs are removed from the body. Answer: A, C Rationale: Half-life refers to the time required for the body to eliminate 50% of the drug. Although half-life is fairly stable, clients with liver or kidney disease may have problems excreting a drug. Difficulty in excreting a drug increases the half-life and increases the risk of toxicity, because these organs do not remove the substances and the drug remains in the body longer. Older clients or clients with impaired kidney or liver function require frequent diagnostic tests measuring renal or hepatic function.
