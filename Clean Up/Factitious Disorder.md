Factitious Disorder, also known as Munchausen Syndrome, is a mental health condition in which an individual deliberately creates or exaggerates physical or psychological symptoms to assume the role of a sick person. These individuals may fabricate or induce illnesses, injuries, or symptoms to gain attention, [[sympathy]], or medical care. They may go to great lengths to deceive healthcare professionals, including self-harm or ingesting toxic substances. This disorder can lead to unnecessary medical interventions, strain on healthcare resources, and emotional distress for the affected individual and their family. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help the individual understand and address the underlying psychological issues driving the behavior.
