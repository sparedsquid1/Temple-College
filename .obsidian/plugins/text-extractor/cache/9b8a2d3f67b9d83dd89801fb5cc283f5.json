Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map Mr. Diaz – Spinal Cord Injury Mr. Diaz is a 23-year-old veteran who returned home from being deployed overseas 2 years ago, with a T4 spinal cord injury from gunfire overseas. He presents to your emergency room with complaints of being tired all the time and not feeling well. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map (continued) He has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) orally, BP 140/82, which is abnormally high for him. The nurse performs his intake assessment and interview and finds that he has been drinking about 10 beers a day, and states that “I don’t feel like a man anymore because I have to wear this catheter (urinary) and cannot control my bowels or do the things that I used to do before my accident.” The RN asked that you draw blood for a BUN and creatinine, which came back as BUN = 35 mg/dL with a creatinine of 1.56 mg/dL. Copyright ©2023 F.A. Davis Company Case Study With Concept Map: Activity ▪ What nursing concepts would be used for Mr. Diaz’s case? ▪ Can you see how the concepts in Mr. Diaz’s care are related? ▪ Work with your group to create a concept map showing relationships between the concepts. ▪ Continue the map to show patient cues, nursing interventions, and collaborative relationships.
