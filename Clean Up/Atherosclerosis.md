Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits, called plaques, within the walls of arteries. These plaques are primarily composed of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin (a clotting material in the [[Blood]]). Over time, the accumulation of plaques can lead to the hardening and narrowing of the arteries, restricting [[Blood]] [[flow]].

Key features of atherosclerosis include:

1. **Plaque Formation**: Plaques develop gradually as fats, cholesterol, and other substances accumulate in the inner lining of arteries.
2. **Inflammation**: The arterial walls may become inflamed, further contributing to plaque buildup.
3. **Reduced [[Blood]] [[flow]]**: Narrowed arteries can restrict [[Blood]] [[flow]] to organs and tissues, which may cause various health issues.
4. **Risk of Clots**: Plaques can rupture, leading to the formation of [[Blood]] clots that can obstruct [[Blood]] [[flow]] or break off and travel to other parts of the body.

Atherosclerosis can affect arteries anywhere in the body, leading to different health problems depending on the location:

- **Coronary Arteries**: Can result in coronary artery disease (CAD), leading to chest pain (angina) or [[Heart]] attacks.
- **Carotid Arteries**: Can lead to carotid artery disease, increasing the risk of stroke.
- **Peripheral Arteries**: Can cause peripheral artery disease (PAD), resulting in pain or numbness in the limbs.
- **Renal Arteries**: Can affect kidney function and lead to hypertension (high [[Blood]] pressure).

Risk factors for atherosclerosis include high cholesterol, high [[Blood]] pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and a diet high in saturated fats and trans fats. Prevention and treatment often involve lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgical procedures to restore proper [[Blood]] [[flow]].
