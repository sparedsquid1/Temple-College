A client has returned to the clinic for follow-up of an infection which is being treated with an aminoglycoside and reports ringing in the ears and dizziness. When developing this client's plan of care, which nursing diagnosis would be the priority? A) Impaired Comfort B) Altered Thought Process C) Diarrhea D) Injury Risk Answer: D Rationale: The development of ototoxicity would lead the nurse to identify a nursing diagnosis of Injury Risk related to the effects of ototoxicity. Although the client's ringing in the ears could cause discomfort, the priority nursing diagnosis would be Injury Risk. There is no evidence of Impaired Comfort, Altered Thought Process, or Diarrhea.

A client is scheduled for abdominal surgery and is ordered to receive neomycin. The client asks the nurse why this drug is prescribed. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “You have an infection now and will probably have one after surgery, so this will help control it.” B) “We need to lower the levels of ammonia in your bloodstream to prevent problems.” C) “The drug helps eliminate bacteria so that your GI tract is as clean as possible for surgery.” D) “This is to help prevent you from developing any blood clots during and after the surgery.” Answer: C Rationale: Neomycin is used before surgery to reduce intestinal bacteria. It is thought that this reduces the possibility of abdominal infection that may occur after surgery on the bowel. By destroying bacteria in the gut and washing it out with laxatives or enemas, the surgical area becomes as clean as possible before the operation. The drug is not used to control an infection preoperatively. It does help to reduce blood ammonia levels with hepatic coma, but this is not the reason for its use with this client. The drug has no effect on preventing blood clots postoperatively.

A client is ordered to receive neomycin as part of the treatment plan for hepatic coma. Which action would be most important for the nurse to assess before administering this drug? Select all that apply. A) Ability to swallow B) Level of consciousness C) Baseline vital signs D) Pulmonary function E) Culture and sensitivity results Answer: A, B Rationale: During the early stages of hepatic coma, various changes in the level of consciousness may be seen. At times, the client may appear lethargic and respond poorly to commands. Because of these changes in the level of consciousness, the client may have difficulty swallowing, and a danger of aspiration is present. If the client appears to have difficulty taking an oral drug, the nurse should withhold the drug and contact the primary health care provider. Baseline vital signs are important but are not the priority when the client has hepatic coma. The drug does not affect the client's respiratory function. There is no infection; therefore, there is no need for culture and sensitivity testing.
