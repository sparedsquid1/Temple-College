**Summary**

This document provides an overview of growth, development, and nutrition in children. It covers various aspects of [[child development]], including growth spurts and plateaus, [[Developmental]] screening tests (such as the Denver II), factors influencing growth and development (e.g., hereditary traits, sex, environment, nationality/race, position in family, health/nutrition status, parental attitudes), family structures (nuclear, extended, foster parent, alternative, dual career, blended, single parent, polygamous, [[cohabitation]], homeless), the Family APGAR system (adaptation, partnership, growth, affection, resolve), nutrition needs for infants and children, [[childhood obesity]], tooth development, play stages (exploration, imitation, parallel play, cooperative play, creative play, symbolic group play, competitive play, [[fantasy play]], cliques, daydreaming), and anticipatory guidance/safety.

**Growth**

* Growth refers to an increase in physical size measured in inches or feet, and pounds (or centimeters and kilograms).
* Growth rate varies with individual child.
* Growth spurts are often followed by plateaus.
* Must understand normal growth to recognize deviations from this.

**Development**

* Development refers to a progressive increase in the function of the body.
* Cephalocaudal development: head to toe.
* Proximodistal development: midline to periphery.
* Development is from the general to the specific.
* Maturation refers to the total way in which a person grows and develops as dictated by inheritance.

**Physiologic Processes**

* Metabolic rate: higher
* Respirations: irregular; small airways
* Cardiovascular: higher HR; anemia
* [[Immunity]]: passive (from mom)
* Kidneys: immature <2 yrs of age
* Nervous system: reflexes replaced by purposeful behavior
* Sleep patterns: varies with age
* Body surface area (BSA): greater than an adult, therefore higher increase in loss of fluids thru lungs and skin

**Growth Percentiles**

* 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%
* Height/Weight: 2 percentile difference; needs to be investigated

**[[Developmental]] Screening**

* Denver II
* Tests for social, fine-motor adaptive, language and [[gross motor skills]]
* First 6 years of life
* NOT an intelligence test

**Factors Influencing Growth and Development**

* Hereditary traits
* Sex
* Environment
* Nationality/Race
* Position in family
* Health/Nutrition Status
* Parental Attitudes

**Family Structures**

* Nuclear
* Extended
* Foster parent
* Alternative
* Dual career
* Blended
* Single parent
* Polygamous
* [[cohabitation]]
* Homeless

**Family APGAR**

* Adaptation
* Partnership
* Growth
* Affection
* Resolve

**Nutrition**

* Be aware of cultural differences
* Infants require more calories, protein, [[minerals]], [[Vitamins]] and fluids than adults
* Fiber needs are less for small child
* Serving size for child 1tbsp/year of age
* Starts prenatally

**[[childhood obesity]]**

* One-third overweight
* Related to adult obesity
* Health concerns
* BMI
* What are some influences in our society that promote Obesity?

**Tooth Development**

* First tooth usually erupts at 6-7 months
* By 1 year, baby usually has 6 [[Teeth]]
* First dental appt. between 1-3 years
* Bottle-[[Mouth]] caries – seen most often at 18 months – 3 years of age
* Children are at risk for trauma to [[Teeth]]
* Adolescents are at risk for gingivitis, TMJ

**Play**

* Provides a sense of accomplishment
* Understanding of child-parent relationship can be gained by observing play
* Encourages self-expression
* Therapeutic play
* Art play
* Computer games
* Play stages:
	+ Infants: Exploration, imitation – provide stimuli
	+ 1-2 years: Parallel play
	+ 3-5 years: Cooperative play – roles
	+ 5-7 years: Creative play – imagination
	+ 7-10 years: Symbolic group play
	+ 10-13 years: Competitive play - rules
	+ 13-18 years: [[fantasy play]], cliques, daydreaming

**Anticipatory Guidance/Safety**

* Children are vulnerable to injury because they:
	+ Are naturally curious and enjoy exploring
	+ Are driven to test and master new skills
	+ Often assert themselves and challenge rules
* Children are vulnerable to injury because they:
	+ Frequently attempt activities before they have developed the cognitive and physical skills required to safely accomplish the task
	+ Develop a strong desire for peer approval as they get older
