Chronic Lymphocytic [[Leukemia]] (CLL) is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphocytes, a kind of white [[Blood]] cell crucial for the immune system. It is the most common type of [[Leukemia]] in adults, especially affecting older individuals. CLL progresses more slowly than acute leukemias, and many people with CLL live for years without symptoms or needing treatment.

### Causes and Risk Factors:
- **Genetic Mutations**: The exact cause of CLL is unknown, but it involves genetic mutations in the DNA of B lymphocytes, leading to their uncontrolled growth.
- **Age**: The risk of developing CLL increases with age, with most cases diagnosed in people over 60.
- **Family History**: Having a family member with CLL or another [[Blood]] or bone marrow cancer increases the risk.
- **Gender**: CLL is more common in men than in women.
- **Exposure to Chemicals**: Exposure to certain chemicals, such as Agent Orange (used during the Vietnam War), may increase the risk.
- **Ethnicity**: CLL is more common in people of European descent and less common in Asian populations.

### Symptoms:
Many people with CLL do not experience symptoms in the early stages, and the disease is often discovered during routine [[Blood]] tests. When symptoms do occur, they can include:
- **Fatigue**: A common symptom due to anemia or the body's immune response.
- **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Particularly in the neck, armpits, or groin.
- **Enlarged Spleen (Splenomegaly)**: Can cause discomfort or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen.
- **Frequent Infections**: Resulting from immune system dysfunction, as the abnormal lymphocytes crowd out normal cells.
- **Unintentional Weight Loss**: Often a sign of more advanced disease.
- **Night Sweats**: Can be a common symptom in some patients.
- **[[Fever]]**: Without an obvious cause, such as infection.

### Diagnosis:
CLL is usually diagnosed through a combination of tests:
- **Complete [[Blood]] Count (CBC)**: Typically shows an elevated white [[Blood]] cell count, particularly of lymphocytes.
- **[[flow]] Cytometry**: A specialized test that identifies the types of cells involved, confirming the diagnosis of CLL.
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: May be done to assess the extent of the disease, though it is not always necessary.
- **Immunophenotyping**: Helps identify the specific type of CLL by analyzing the proteins on the surface of the [[Leukemia]] cells.
- **[[genetic testing]]**: To identify chromosomal abnormalities and mutations, which can help determine the prognosis and [[Guide]] treatment.

### Staging:
CLL is staged differently than other cancers, using systems like the Rai and Binet systems, which classify the disease based on the number of affected lymphoid tissues (such as lymph nodes, spleen, and [[Liver]]) and the presence of anemia or low platelet counts.

### Treatment:
Treatment for CLL depends on the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and the presence of symptoms. Some patients, particularly those with early-stage CLL, may not need immediate treatment and are monitored through a strategy called "watchful waiting."

For those who require treatment, options include:
- **Chemotherapy**: Often used in combination with other therapies. Common [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] include [[fludarabine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], and [[bendamustine]].
- **Targeted Therapy**:
  - **Brutonâ€™s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors**: Such as [[ibrutinib]] and [[acalabrutinib]], which block signals that help the [[Leukemia]] cells survive.
  - **BCL-2 Inhibitors**: Like [[venetoclax]], which helps induce the death of CLL cells.
  - **Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) Inhibitors**: Such as [[idelalisib]], used in certain cases.
- **[[Monoclonal antibodies]]**: Such as [[rituximab]], [[obinutuzumab]], or [[ofatumumab]], which target specific proteins on the surface of CLL cells.
- **Stem Cell Transplantation**: In rare cases, particularly for younger patients or those with aggressive disease, a stem cell transplant may be considered.
- **Immunotherapy**: Newer treatments like CAR T-cell therapy, which re-engineer a patient's own T cells to attack CLL cells, are being explored.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for CLL varies widely based on several factors, including the patient's age, overall health, the stage of the disease at diagnosis, and specific genetic mutations in the [[Leukemia]] cells. Some people with CLL live for many years without symptoms and may not require treatment. For others, the disease may progress more rapidly and require earlier intervention.

Regular monitoring and follow-up care are essential for managing CLL, even if immediate treatment is not needed. Advances in treatment have significantly improved outcomes for many patients, and ongoing research continues to explore new therapies that may further enhance survival and quality of life for those with CLL.
