Granulocytopenia is a medical condition characterized by a significant decrease in the number of granulocytes, a type of white [[Blood]] cell, in the [[Blood]]. Granulocytes, which include [[Neutrophils]], eosinophils, and basophils, play a critical role in the immune system by fighting infections, especially bacterial and fungal infections.

When the level of granulocytes is abnormally low, the body's ability to fight off infections is compromised, leading to an increased risk of infections.

### Common causes of granulocytopenia include:
- **Bone marrow disorders** (e.g., [[Leukemia]], [[aplastic anemia]])
- **Certain medications** (e.g., chemotherapy, antibiotics)
- **Autoimmune diseases** where the immune system mistakenly attacks the bone marrow
- **Radiation therapy**
- **Severe infections** that deplete granulocytes
- **Nutritional deficiencies** (e.g., vitamin [[B12]] or folate deficiency)

### Symptoms:
- **Frequent infections** (e.g., recurrent fevers, [[Mouth]] sores, skin infections)
- **Fatigue** due to the body's struggle to combat infections
- **General weakness**

Treatment for granulocytopenia depends on the underlying cause and may involve stopping the causative medication, treating the infection, or stimulating the production of granulocytes with medications like granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-[[CSF]]).
