B. Describe what area you feel needs improvement for your continuing competence and professional growth and why? (Must have a minimum of 5 complete sentences) I need to expand my knowledge of the EMR software and find orders and MAR. I want to have a better understanding of medicine, namely classes and MOA. I would like to learn more about the roles and responsibilities of staff in order to better understand future career possibilities. I need to manage my time better, spending less time talking to patients about non-pertinent initially to have time to round with other patients. Build rapport and trust quicker and know how/when to exit (was able to improve slightly this week). I need to improve upon patient care summary reports. Ensure wording reflects exactly the goals and/or interventions that are targeted (was able to improve on this week).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
