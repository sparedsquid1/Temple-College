Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is one of the most common and severe types of muscular dystrophy, primarily affecting boys. DMD is caused by mutations in the **DMD [[gene]]**, which encodes dystrophin, a protein that is essential for maintaining the structural [[integrity]] of muscle cells.

### Causes:
- **Genetic Mutation:** DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD [[gene]] on the X [[chromosome]]. This [[gene]] is responsible for producing dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. In DMD, the mutation leads to little or no production of dystrophin, causing muscle cells to be damaged easily and leading to muscle weakness and deterioration over time.
- **X-Linked Recessive Inheritance:** DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Since males have only one X [[chromosome]] (XY), a single mutated copy of the [[gene]] is enough to cause the disease. Females (XX), who have two X chromosomes, are usually carriers and may pass the mutation to their offspring, but they rarely show symptoms.

### Symptoms:
Symptoms typically appear in [[early childhood]], usually between ages 2 and 5. The progression of the disease leads to increasing disability.

- **Early Signs:**
  - **Delayed Motor Milestones:** Late walking, difficulty running, jumping, or climbing stairs.
  - **Frequent Falls:** Muscle weakness leading to frequent falls.
  - **Difficulty Rising from the Floor (Gowers' Sign):** Children often use their hands to push on their legs to stand up.
  - **Enlarged Calf Muscles:** Pseudohypertrophy, where the calves appear larger due to fat and connective tissue replacing muscle.

- **Progression:**
  - **Muscle Weakness:** Progresses from the legs and pelvis to the arms, neck, and other areas. By early teens, many patients lose the ability to walk and require a wheelchair.
  - **[[Respiratory]] and Cardiac Problems:** As the disease progresses, muscles that control breathing and the [[Heart]] can be affected, leading to [[Respiratory]] difficulties and cardiomyopathy ([[Heart]] muscle weakness).

### Diagnosis:
- **[[genetic testing]]:** Confirms mutations in the DMD [[gene]].
- **Muscle Biopsy:** May be performed to check for the presence or absence of dystrophin in muscle tissue.
- **[[Blood]] Tests:** Elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme that leaks out of damaged muscle cells, may indicate muscle damage.
- **Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies:** Assess muscle and nerve function.

### Treatment:
While there is currently no cure for DMD, treatment focuses on managing symptoms, improving quality of life, and slowing the progression of the disease.

- **[[Corticosteroids]]:** Medications like [[prednisone]] can help slow muscle degeneration and improve strength.
- **Physical Therapy:** Helps maintain muscle function, flexibility, and prevent contractures (permanent shortening of muscles or tendons).
- **Assistive Devices:** Braces, wheelchairs, and other devices can assist with mobility.
- **Cardiac and [[Respiratory]] Care:** Regular monitoring and treatment for [[Heart]] and lung complications.
- **Newer Therapies:** Advances in [[gene]] therapy, exon skipping, and other molecular approaches are being researched and tested in clinical trials to treat the underlying genetic cause of DMD.

### Prognosis:
DMD is a progressive disease, and the life expectancy for individuals with DMD has improved with advances in medical care, especially [[Respiratory]] and cardiac care. Many individuals with DMD now live into their 30s or beyond, though the disease significantly impacts daily life and independence. Early diagnosis and comprehensive care are critical for managing the condition and improving the quality of life.
