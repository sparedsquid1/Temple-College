Hyperkinesia is a medical term that refers to an abnormal increase in muscle movement. These movements can be excessive, involuntary, and often result in fidgeting, restlessness, or jerking motions. Hyperkinesia can manifest in various forms, including:

- **Tremors**: Rhythmic, shaking movements, often seen in hands.
- **Chorea**: Rapid, irregular, and unpredictable movements affecting different parts of the body.
- **Athetosis**: Slow, writhing movements, usually of the hands and feet.
- **Tics**: Sudden, repetitive movements or sounds, commonly seen in conditions like Tourette syndrome.
- **[[dystonia]]**: Sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures.

The condition can be caused by various factors, including genetic disorders (such as Huntington's disease), neurological conditions (like Parkinson's disease), medication side effects, and metabolic issues. Treatment for hyperkinesia depends on the underlying cause and may involve medications, lifestyle changes, or therapies to manage the symptoms.
