Page: 742 Heading: Blood Vessels of the Kidney Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 It is expected that a patient may experience nausea and anxiety following an injury. 2 Ecchymosis and pain in the area of the injury is expected, but require additional monitoring. Ecchymosis is most likely associated with soft tissue injury. 3 The nurse’s greatest concern is the presence of flank edema and bloody urine. The kidneys are highly vascular and major vessels include a renal artery and a Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company renal vein. Both findings are indicative of blood vessel damage. 4 The kidneys are located in the retroperitoneal cavity; pain in the lower abdomen is not expected with this injury.

Page: 723 Heading: Formation of Urine Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Micturition is the terminology for the process of urinating, which is not involved in the process of urine production. 2 Glomerular filtration is the initial process of urine formation. Blood pressure forces water and small solutes out of the glomeruli and into Bowman capsules. The fluid is then called renal filtrate. 3 Tubular excretion is the final process of urine formation. In excretion, substances are actively secreted from the blood in the peritubular capillaries into the filtrate in the renal tubules. 4 Tubular reabsorption is the second process of urine formation. Tubular reabsorption is the recovery of useful materials from the renal filtrate and their return into the blood in the peritubular capillaries. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 6.

Page: 728 Heading: The Kidneys and Acid-Base Balance Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 If the kidneys were absorbing more bicarbonate into the blood, the laboratory test would not indicate metabolic acidosis. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 2 When the kidneys are unable to excrete hydrogen ions into the blood, the laboratory test indicates metabolic acidosis. The process is related to kidney disease. 3 If the kidneys were compensating for respiratory function, the pH would be balanced when the kidneys reabsorbed bicarbonate. 4 Vomiting can cause metabolic alkalosis when hydrochloric acid is lost. However, there is no indication that the patient’s renal disease is causing vomiting. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 7. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 36. Urinary System Function, Assessment, and Therapeutic Measures Objective: Plan preparation and postprocedure care for patients undergoing diagnostic tests of the urinary system. Page: 738 Heading: Elimination of Urine Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The inability to stand to void is not alone the reason to place a suprapubic catheter. 2 Patients with any type of catheter are a high risk for developing bladder infections. 3 The patient with a thoracic spinal cord injury will have lost the sensation of urinary reflex over which urinary control may be exerted. The detrusor muscles of the bladder wall and two urethral sphincters will all be involved. 4 Incontinence and the risk for skin breakdown are not reasons alone to place a suprapubic catheter.

Page: 728 Heading: pH Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Feedback 1 The patient’s urine pH is within normal limits; there is no reason to suspect a bladder infection. 2 Diet has the greatest influence over urine pH. The patient’s urine pH is normal, but is in the higher range. Vegetarians are likely to have a more alkaline urine, which makes the pH higher. 3 Diet has the greatest influence over urine pH. There is no reason for the nurse to inquire about aspirin use. The urine pH is within normal limits. 4 There is no reason to ask if the patient has a family history of renal disease. The urine pH is within normal limits. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 9. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 36.

Page: 728 Heading: Constituents Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Illness does not affect the creatinine level in urine. 2 Being lactose intolerant does not affect the creatinine level in urine. 3 The nurse should not expect flank pain in a patient with an elevated creatinine level. 4 Creatinine is a product of metabolism of creatine phosphate, which is an energy source in muscles. The amount and type of exercise can affect creatinine levels. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 10. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 36.

Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Feedback 1 BUN elevates with dehydration, because the loss of water makes the blood more concentrated. Creatinine levels are a very good indicator of kidney function. 2 There is not enough information to determine if the patient is septic. 3 There is not enough information to determine if the patient is malnourished. 4 There is not enough information to determine if the patient has kidney damage. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 11. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 36. Urinary System Function, Assessment, and Therapeutic Measures Objective: Discuss the effects of aging on the urinary system. Page: 722 Heading: Aging and the Urinary System Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Older adult patients do have a decrease in glomerular filtration; however, this change does not cause frequent urination. 2 The older adult patient’s need for frequent urination is likely associated with physical functioning. There are no other indications of a bladder infection such as fever or painful urination. 3 Older adult patients normally experience a decrease in bladder size and a decrease in the tone of the detrusor muscle. The result is frequent urination or the presence of residual urine after voiding. 4 Older adult patients do have a decrease in renal function; up to half of the original nephrons can be lost by age 70 or 80. However, this is not related to frequent urination. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 12. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 36.

Mashed potatoes and creamed corn are not considered liquids. 2 All oral and IV fluids are counted as fluid intake. 3 Water, coffee, juices, and gelatin are considered liquids. The gelatin will become a liquid at body temperature. 4 Tube feedings are considered liquids when the patient’s I&O is being measured. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 13. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 36.

Page: 725 Heading: Overflow Incontinence Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient is likely to be experiencing overflow incontinence and the suggestion to obtain and use incontinence pads is helpful in managing the manifestations. However, the most helpful suggestion will address the cause. 2 Older men commonly experience overflow incontinence related to an enlarged prostate. The most helpful suggestion is to encourage an appointment with a urologist for treatment of the condition. 3 Medication is sometimes a cause for incontinence; however, medications and their effects can be reviewed during a visit with a urologist. 4 Setting a schedule for regular voiding is appropriate for bladder training, but overflow incontinence will not improve with this intervention.

A. Davis Company Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 It is appropriate for the nurse to inform the patient to empty the bladder every 3 hours when performing intermittent self-catheterization. 2 It is important for the patient to understand that an overfilled urinary bladder is a source of infection. Urine is a good medium for bacteria growth. 3 When in the home environment, urinary catheters used for self-catheterization can be washed and reused. All types of catheterizations in the clinical environment require sterile technique. 4 When away from home, the patient can still perform intermittent self-catheterization and there is no need to wear an incontinence pad. However, the patient is taught to use appropriate hand washing and to be particularly careful to avoid touching the catheter to places or items in surrounding area. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 17.

Davis Company Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Postprocedure for the placement of a suprapubic catheter, it is correct for the nurse to change the surgical dressing as needed. 2 The suprapubic catheter will need to be taped in a manner that prevents tension on the catheter. 3 Postprocedure, the nurse will not be changing the suprapubic catheter, which may result in closure of the abdominal incision. After healing, the patient will learn when and how the catheter will be changed. 4 Because of a likelihood of urine leakage, a skin barrier can be applied to prevent skin irritation or breakdown from exposure to urine.

Page: 725 Heading: Management of Urinary Incontinence Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 The nurse is likely to refer the patient to a urologist for evaluation of the condition and proposed treatment. However, this is not the priority nursing intervention. 2 Because the patient reveals a long-standing problem, the nurse is aware that the patient has possibly delayed reporting the condition due to embarrassment. The nurse’s priority intervention is to provide caring support to the patient. 3 The patient may need to be recommended to a continence clinic; however, this is not the priority nursing intervention. 4 Keeping a voiding diary is helpful in determining when incontinence occurs and identifying of predisposing events. However, this is not the priority nursing intervention. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company MULTIPLE RESPONSE 20. ANS: 3, 4 Chapter: Chapter 36.
