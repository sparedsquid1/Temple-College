Latent (0-3 cm) = Active (4-7 cm) = Transitional (8-10 cm) ● Second Stage:(Stage of Expulsion) Begins with complete cervical dilation and ends with delivery of fetus ● Third Stage:(Placental Stage) Begins immediately after fetus is born and ends when the placenta is delivered ● Fourth Stage:(Maternal Homeostatic Stabilization Stage) Begins after the delivery of the placenta and continues for one to four hours after delivery Fourth Stage of Labor ● Uterus is contracted, midline and near the umbilicus ● Oxytocin is given after the delivery of the placenta to increase uterine contraction and decrease bleeding ● Bladder may be hypotonic from anesthesia, analgesia, trauma ● Vital signs, fundal height and vaginal flow checked every 15 minutes X 5 (1st hour) Following Birth / Care of Baby ● Remember to wear gloves until after the first bath Chapter 7:Nursing Management of Pain During Labor and Birth (11 Questions) Types of Prenatal Classes ● Childbirth ● Exercise ● Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ● Sibling ● Grandparent ● Breastfeeding ● Infant care ● Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) Childbirth Pain ● Part of normal birth process ● Woman has several months to prepare for pain management ● Self-limiting and rapidly declines after birth ● May cause woman to feel vulnerable ● Motivates to assume different positions to assist fetus to descend Sources of Pain During Labor ● Dilation and stretching of cervix ● Reduced uterine blood supply during contractions ● Pressure of fetus on pelvic structures ● Stretching of vagina and perineum Pain Tolerance ● The maximum level of pain that a person is able to tolerate Pain Threshold ● The point at which pain begins to be felt.

● Adverse effects:Aspiration Nursing Care Plan- Woman Needing Pain Management During Labor:Pg. 177 Chapter 8:Nursing Care of Women with Complications During Labor and Birth (16 Questions) BIshop score ● Used to assess the status of the cervix in determining its response to induction ● The presence of increased fetal fibronectin at the cervix and Bishop score above 6 determine cervical readiness for labor induction Induction of labour ● Initiation of uterine contraction artificially after the period of viability before onset of labor for the purpose of secure vaginal delivery Augmentation of labour ● The process of stimulation of uterine contraction (both in frequency and intensity) that are already present but found to be inadequate Amniotomy ● Artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) (amniotic sac) by using a sterile sharp instrument to puncture the amniotic sac and release the amniotic fluid for the purpose of inducing or augmentation labor Amniotomy Complications ● Prolapse may occur if the cord slips downward with a gush of amniotic fluid ● Infection ● Abruptio placentae (separation of the placenta before birth) Amniotomy Nursing Interventions ● Record FHR for at least 1 minute after amniotomy ● Note color, odor, amount, character, time:if fluid is green notify MD ● Maternal temp taken every 2-4 hours notify MD if temp 100.4 or higher ● Change under pads often Pitocin/ Augmentation of Labor ● Assess first to make sure CPD is not present, then start procedure ● Give 10 units/ 1000 cc. fluid and hang as a secondary infusion, never as primary Pitocin/ Augmentation of Labor/ Nursing Care ● Assess contractions-are they increasing but not tetanic ● Assess dilation and effacement ● Monitor vital signs and FHT ● Make sure no signs of hyperstimulation before increasing dose Complications of Oxytocin Induction and augmentation of Labor ● Most common is related to overstimulation of contractions ● Fetal compromise-blood flow to placenta is reduced with excessive contractions ● Uterine rupture ● Water intoxication inhibits excretion of urine and promotes fluid retention Amnioinfusion ● The injection of warmed sterile saline or lactated Ringer’s solution into the uterus via an intrauterine pressure catheter during labor after the membranes have ruptured Indications for Amnioinfusion ● Oligohydramnios (lower-than-normal amount of amniotic fluid) ● Umbilical cord compression resulting from lack of amniotic fluid ● Reduce recurrent variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate ● Diluting meconium-stained amniotic fluid to prevent meconium aspiration External Cephalic Version ● Repositioning of fetus within the uterus to convert breech to cephalic presentation ● Rationale:Performed in non-laboring women at or near term to increase likelihood of vaginal birth ● Good candidates:Low-risk, >37 wks External Cephalic Version Procedure ● Tocolytic to relax uterine and abdominal wall muscles ● WinRho to Rh-women ● Disengage the breech and manipulate the fetus ● Consistent fetal heart monitoring Episiotomy Healing Evaluation:REEDA ● Redness ● Edema ● Ecchymosis ● Discharge, drainage ● Approximation Lacerations of the Birth Canal ● First degree:Involves skin and vaginal mucosa but not underlying fascia and muscle ● Second degree:Involves fascia and muscle of the perineal body but not the anal sphincter ● Third degree:Involves the anal sphincter but does not extend through it ● Fourth degree:Extends through the anal sphincter into the rectum lumen Forceps and Vacuum Extraction Births ● An obstetrician uses obstetric forceps and vacuum extractors to provide traction and rotation to the fetal head when the mothers pushing efforts are insufficient to accomplish a safe delivery ● Forceps are instruments with curved blades that fit around the fetal head without unduly compressing it Types of Cesarean Incisions ● Vertical:Classical upper segment operation, a vertical right paramedian incision from level of umbilicus to 3 cm above symphysis pubis ● Horizontal:Curved Pfannenstiel incision following the Lnagers lines in the skin, about 3 cm above the pubis in the center Postoperative Care ●

Talk to your doctor or midwife about preterm labor Preterm Labor/ Nursing Labor ● Bedrest ● Monitoring uterine activity and FHR ● Administer tocolytic agents which relaxes smooth muscle and stops the contractions (Terbutaline (Brethine), Nifedipine (Adalt), Magnesium sulfate) ● Administer corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone) Magnesium Sulfate Nursing Implications ● Monitor respirations >14-16;<12 is critical ● Assess reflexes for hypo-reflexia–D/C if hypo-refexia ● Measure Urinary Output >100cc in 4 hrs ● Measure Magnesium levels:Normal is 1.5-2.5 mg/dl;Therapeutic is 2-8 mg/dl;Toxicity is >9 mg/dl;Absence of reflexes is >10 mg/dl;Respiratory arrest is 12-15 mg/dl;Cardiac arrest is >15 mg/dl ● Have Calcium Gluconate available as antagonist ● Given to decrease the chance of cerebral palsy to the newborn Nursing interventions:(Magnesium sulfate) ● Continuous fetal monitoring ● Monitor for maternal toxicity-weakness and lethargy from the blocking of the neuromuscular transmission ● Have calcium gluconate available-as antidote for toxicity ● Maintain client in left lateral position in low stimulation environment ● Monitor for S/E Prolong Pregnancy ● Definition:“its is defined as the pregnancy progressing to 42 weeks (294 days) or beyond” ● It is also called post-dates or post-term pregnancy Maternal Risks ● It includes: ● Anxiety ● Operative delivery ● Prolong labour and instrumental delivery ● Hemorrhage ● Infection Risk Associated With Prolonged Pregnancy ● Fetal risks: ● Prolonged pregnancy is associated with ● Increase risk of perinatal mortality including antepartum stillbirths and infant death. It is 0.86/1000 at 40 weeks and 2.12/1000 at 43 weeks, almost 3 folds increase ● Fetal distress is more common B/C of placental insufficiency and cord compression d/t oligohydramnios. Prolapsed Cord ● Condition where the cord presents through the birth canal before delivery of the head ● Presents a serious emergency which endangers the life of the unborn baby ● Risk factor:Fetal head is engaged or at a high station ● Vessels carrying blood to & from the fetus are compressed, usually results in fetal distress or possible demise Nursing Care in Prolapsed Umbilical Cord ● Assess for nonreassuring fetal status ● If a loop of cord is discovered, the examiners gloved fingers must remain in vagina to provide firm pressure on fetal head until physician or CNM arrives ● Oxygen via face mask ● Monitor FHR to determine whether cord compression is adequately relived ● Knee chest position Uterine rupture ● Uterine rupture is a spontaneous or traumatic rupture of the uterus After an amniotomy, which observation should be reported immediately? Answer:Fetal heart rate of 95 bpm A woman, gravida 4, para 3, has been 5 cm dilated for 2 hours. Her contractions are every 7 minutes, 30 second duration, and mild. THe FHR is 135-145/minute.
