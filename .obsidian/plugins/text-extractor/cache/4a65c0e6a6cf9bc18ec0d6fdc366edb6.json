A group of nursing students are preparing a presentation depicting the cell cycles and the chemotherapeutic agents that work best at each phase. The instructor determines the students have correctly illustrated the information by including antimetabolites at which phase? A) S phase B) M phase C) G2 phase D) G1 phase Answer: A Rationale: Antimetabolite drugs are substances that incorporate themselves into the cellular components during the S phase of cell division. This interferes with the synthesis of RNA and DNA, making it impossible for the cancerous cell to divide into two daughter cells. The vinca alkaloids interfere with amino acid production in the S phase and formation of microtubules in the M phase. Taxanes also interfere in the M phase with microtubules. Cells are stopped during the S and G2 phases by the podophyllotoxins and thus are unable to divide. DNA synthesis during the S phase is inhibited by camptothecin analog drugs such as topotecan.
