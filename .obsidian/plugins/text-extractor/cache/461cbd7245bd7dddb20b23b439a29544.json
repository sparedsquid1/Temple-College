A nurse concludes a nursing diagnosis of Altered Health Management is appropriate for a client who has stopped taking prescribed medications. Which factor would be most important for the nurse to determine? A) When the client stopped taking the drug B) What adverse reactions the client experienced C) What was the exact reason for stopping the drug D) Whether the client's symptoms were relieved with the drug Answer: C Rationale: Lack of adherence with drugs can occur for numerous reasons. Therefore, it is most important for the nurse to determine the exact reason that the client stopped the therapy. Additional information can then be obtained, such as when the client stopped, if and what adverse reactions the client experienced, and if relief was obtained.

A nurse caring for a client is articulating the steps for carrying out nursing activities that will assist in achieving client goals. The nurse is in which phase of the nursing process? A) Assessment B) Planning C) Implementation D) Evaluation Answer: B Rationale: The planning phase of the nursing process involves describing steps for carrying out nursing activities that will assist in achieving client goals or expected outcomes. The assessment phase involves collecting facts by means of a physical examination and through information supplied by the client or the client's family. During the implementation phase, the nurse carries out a defined plan of action. Evaluation is a decision-making process that involves determining the effectiveness of the nursing interventions in meeting the expected outcomes.

After teaching a group of nursing students about nursing diagnoses, the instructor determines that the teaching was successful when the students correctly point out which item as the most useful related to the nursing diagnoses developed by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association-International (NANDA-I)? A) Identifying client problems related to drug therapy B) Classifying the clients according to their age groups C) Categorizing the drugs based on their therapeutic actions D) Identifying the expected outcomes of treatments given Answer: A Rationale: Some of the nursing diagnoses developed by NANDA-I are useful in identifying client problems related to drug therapy and are more commonly used when administering drugs. The nursing diagnoses developed by NANDA-I do not classify the clients according to their age groups or the drugs based on their actions. NANDA-I nursing diagnoses do not identify the expected outcome of treatments given. An expected outcome will be specifically related to the kind of drug treatment given to the client. After the nursing diagnoses are formulated, the nurse develops expected outcomes, which are client oriented. The expected outcomes will be generated through efficient planning and implementation of the care plan. NANDA-I nursing diagnoses are not used to identify expected outcomes for clients. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 1 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Safe and Effective Care Environment: Coordinated Care Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 50, Nursing Diagnosis 5. A nurse is caring for a client diagnosed with a respiratory condition for which drug therapy has been prescribed. What would the nurse need to address when developing appropriate expected outcomes related to the drug therapy? A) Amount of time the client will take to recover fully B) Number of drugs the client will require during the treatment C) Possible adverse reactions that could occur during the therapy D) Maximum level of wellness reasonably attainable for the client Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should know that the expected outcome describes the maximum level of wellness that is reasonably attainable for the client and that the therapeutic effect is achieved. The expected outcome for a client does not include the amount of time the client will take to recover fully, the number of drugs the client will require during the treatment, or the possible adverse reactions that could occur during the therapy. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 50, Planning 6. A client with a cardiac disorder is being discharged home. What would the nurse include when teaching the client about administering the prescribed drug therapy at home? A) Composition of the drug B) Disorders treated using the drug C) Method of drug administration D) Contraindications of the drug Answer: C Rationale: When the client is willing and able to manage the treatment regimen, the nurse should provide information concerning the drug, the method of administration, what type of reactions to expect, and what to report to the primary health care provider. A client willing to take responsibility for their treatment may need the nurse to develop a teaching plan that gives the client the information needed to properly manage the therapeutic regimen. The nurse need not educate the client on the composition of the drug or the disorders for which the drug is used, because this information will not assist the client in administering the drug by themselves to achieve the therapeutic effect. The nurse ensures that the drug is not contraindicated for the client before its administration. Therefore, it is considered safe for the client to take the drug independently. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 51, Nursing Actions Based Upon Nursing Diagnoses 7. A nurse is providing care to a client who has been admitted to the health care facility. When administering drugs to this client, what would be most important for the nurse to do before administering a drug to the client? A) Review the subjective and objective data. B) Provide the basis for the selection of nursing interventions. C) Review the related nursing diagnosis. D) List the potential goals to be achieved by the client. Answer: A Rationale: Before administering a drug, the nurse should review the subjective and objective data obtained on assessment and consider any additional data, such as blood pressure, pulse, or statements made by the client. The decision of whether to administer the drug is based on an analysis of all information. Listing the potential goals to be achieved helps in determining the expected outcome for the client from the therapy. The nurse does not need to list the potential outcome to be achieved by the client before administering a drug. Nursing diagnosis provides a framework for the selection of nursing interventions, but it is not a nursing intervention, which should be performed before administering a drug. Nursing diagnosis helps in formulating a care plan for the client. The nurse does not need to review the nursing diagnosis before administering drugs to the client. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 48, Assessment 8. A nurse who has been caring for a client determines that the plan has been successful based on which factor? A) Expected outcomes are accomplished. B) Client does not experience anxiety during therapy. C) Client is better able to communicate with the nurse. D) Subjective and objective data are successfully obtained. Answer: A Rationale: The evaluation is complete and successful if the expected outcomes are accomplished or if progress occurs. If the outcomes are not accomplished, different interventions are needed. If the client does not experience anxiety during therapy, then the nurse is better able to implement the care planned for the client and expect maximum effectiveness during evaluation. The evaluation of the care plan is not considered complete just because the client does not experience anxiety during therapy, although it facilitates receiving a positive response during evaluation. Similarly, if the client is able to effectively communicate their feelings to the nurse, the nurse can implement the care plan in a better way to yield maximum therapeutic results for the client. Good communication alone should not be considered a factor that completes the evaluation for the client. Obtaining subjective and objective data is important for accurate drug administration and therapy implementation. Evaluation for a client cannot be considered complete only on the basis of subjective and objective data. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 53, Evaluation 9. A nurse is assigned to care for a client with a cardiac disorder. During assessment, which action would be most appropriate for the nurse to complete when obtaining objective data related to the client's condition? A) Review the client's health history. B) Auscultate heart and lung sounds. C) Review the client's family history. D) Inquire about the client's eating habits. Answer: B Rationale: To obtain objective data from the client, the nurse would auscultate heart and lung sounds. Objective data include the facts obtained through physical assessment or physical examination. Reviewing the client's health and family history and inquiring about the client's eating habits will help the nurse in obtaining subjective data, which also include facts supplied by the client and the client's family. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 48, Assessment 10. A nurse prepares to administer a prescribed medication and collects the necessary data. Based on this information, the nurse decides to withhold the drug and contact the prescriber. The nurse is in which phase of the nursing process? A) Assessment B) Planning C) Implementation D) Evaluation Answer: C Rationale: Giving or withholding a drug and contacting the client's health care provider are nursing activities related to the implementation phase of the nursing process. Assessment is reflected in the data collection that the nurse has completed. Planning anticipates what will happen in the implementation phase. Evaluation would occur after the drug is administered and the nurse determines if the client is experiencing therapeutic and/or adverse effects. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 51, Implementation 11. After administering a prescribed medication for pain relief, the nurse is evaluating the client's response to therapy. Which finding would the nurse document as objective data? A) Client identifies a pain rating of 3 out of 10. B) Client states that the pain is much less. C) Client's spouse reports the client was moaning during sleep. D) Client reports feeling sleepy after taking the drug. Answer: A Rationale: Pain rating is an objective measure and thus would be documented as such. Client statements such as the pain being much less or reports of feeling sleepy are subjective data. Information from others, such as the client's spouse, would also be considered subjective data. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 4 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 48, Assessment 12. The nurse determines a nursing diagnosis of Altered Health Management for a client. What would the nurse most likely identify as the expected outcome? A) Client verbalizes understanding of when to call the health care provider. B) Client demonstrates ability to maintain adherence to prescribed drug therapy. C) Client verbalizes desire to manage prescribed medication schedule. D) Client identifies the reason for the prescribed drug therapy for the illness. Answer: B Rationale: Demonstrating the ability to maintain adherence to the prescribed therapy would be the best outcome for a nursing diagnosis of Altered Health Management. Although there can be numerous reasons for nonadherence, this outcome addresses the importance of the therapeutic plan. Verbalizing an understanding of when to call the health care provider and identifying reasons for the prescribed drug would be appropriate outcomes for the nursing diagnosis. Verbalizing a desire to manage the prescribed medication schedule would correlate with an absence of this nursing diagnosis.
