She expresses concerns about holding the baby too much when he cries because she is afraid of spoiling him. What should the nurse tell the mother about the infant’s emotional development? 7 Emotional Development • Consistency must be established to develop trust, which is vital to the development of a healthy personality. • Infants who are consistently picked up when they cry tend to have fewer crying episodes and less aggressive behavior as toddlers. • Infants will easily accomplish various activities if they are not forced before they reach readiness. • When infant shows readiness to learn a task, parents should provide encouragement. 8 1/13/2025 5 Physical Characteristics Skin • Milia – small white papules • Nevi – “stork bites” • Mongolian Spots 9 Need for Constant Care and Guidance • Sensory stimulation is essential for the development of the infant’s thought processes and perceptual abilities. • A crying child should be soothed. • If an infant appears hungry, do not delay the feeding in order to adhere to a specific routine. • An infant can recognize warmth and affection or the lack thereof. 10 1/13/2025 6 Infant Development 1 month • Head lag still present • Sleeps 20 hours/day • Place on back to sleep • Hormones from mom 11 Infant Development 2 months • Posterior fontanel closes • Holds head erect briefly • Immunization • Dtap, RV, HIB, IPV, PCV, and Hep B • Responsive smiling • Cries tears • May have colic 12 1/13/2025 7 Infant Development 3 months • Good head control • Hands to mouth • Holds rattle • Enjoys interaction 13 Infant Development 4 months • Drooling; teething • Lifts head & shoulders when on belly • Reaches for objects • Immunizations • Dtap, RV, HIB, IPV, PCV 14 1/13/2025 8 Infant Development 5 months • Sits with support • Plays with toes • Reaches/tries to hold bottle • 2-3 naps/day 15 Infant Development 6 months  Doubles birth weight  Turns over  Pulls to sitting  Can drink from cup  Babbles  Intro solid foods – rice cereal  Grabs with whole hand.  Immunizations  Dtap, RV, HIB, IPV, PCV, and Hep B 16 1/13/2025 9 Infant Development 7 months • Beginning to crawl • Transfers objects • Mood swings • Teething/pain • Lower central incisors first to erupt • Add fruit, finger foods (Zwieback crackers) • Grasp with hand 17 Infant Development 8 months • Sits alone • Begins using pincer grasp • Add vegetables • 2 naps/day 18 1/13/2025 10 Infant Development 9 months • Hand preference • Imitates sounds • “Cruising” – allow exploration • Add meat/beans to diet (chopped or mashed) 19 Infant Development 10 months  Stands with support  Recognizes own name  Drinks juice and/or water from cup 20 1/13/2025 11 Infant Development 11 months • Understands simple directions • Lots of gross motor activity 21 Infant Development 12 months  Triple birth weight  6 teeth  Well developed pincer grasp  May play at mealtime  Immunizations  MMR, Hep A, Dtap, Hib, PCV, Varicella 22 1/13/2025 12 Coping with an Irritable Infant • Colic • Shield infants’ eyes from bright light. • Sit quietly with infant; don’t talk or sing. • Eliminate as much noise as possible. • Talk in a soft voice. • Swaddle snugly. • Change infant’s position slowly; avoid sudden movements. • Provide nonnutritive sucking. 23 Coping with the Lethargic Infant • Some infants respond to an excessively stimulating environment by “shutting down” and sleeping. Coping strategies include: • Avoid bright lights. • Move and handle the infant slowly and gently. • Talk in a calm voice. • Sit the infant upright at intervals. • Slowly dress and undress the infant. 24 1/13/2025 13 Developing Positive Sleep Patterns • Newborns sleep in 4-hour intervals. • By 4 to 6 months, can be up to 8 hours • Synchronizing circadian rhythm of infant to family routine is a learned behavior. • Position infants on their backs on a firm mattress. • Infants rely on parent to soothe them back to sleep if awakened during the night. • Assist infant to learn self-soothing behaviors 25 Illness Prevention • 2 weeks, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months • Measure growth parameters • Assess developmental level – if there are issues, may refer to comm. agency • Administer immunizations/draw labs • Anticipatory Guidance • Address parenting issues 26 1/13/2025 14 Childhood Immunizations 27 Nutrition in Infancy Perfect nutrition during first year of life – Breast milk or Formula • Make sure formula is mixed correctly (Table 16-1) • No foods added into the bottle • Whole cow’s milk should not be given until after 1 year of age • Low-fat milk should not be given under 2 years of age 28 1/13/2025 15 Nutrition in Infancy • First food introduced – Rice cereal at 5-6 months of age (extrusion reflex); then foods added one at a time every 4-7 days • Give solid foods then formula • Diluted juices added at 5-6 months of age – use “sipper” cup • Insure adequate fat intake • Adequacy of diet • Weaning 29 Play • Explore • Imitate • Provide visual stimuli for newborns • Touch stimuli for infants • Toys involving manipulation for 1 year old 30 1/13/2025 16 Safety Issues/ Anticipatory Guidance • Motor vehicle accidents – car seat • Falls – monitor closely • Choking – toys, foods (nuts, popcorn, grapes, raw carrots, hot dogs) • Suffocation – proper placement in crib • Poisoning – cabinet locks; out of reach • Burns – sunscreen, protecting outlets • Drowning – supervision; gates • Toy safety 31 Summary • No two babies are the same • Very rapid growth/development during first year of life • Wt doubles by 6 months, triples by one year • Ht increases 2.5cm/month for 6 mos. • FOC increases 1.5cm/month for 6 mos, then 0.5cm/month until 1 year • Anterior fontanelle closes by 18 months • Posterior fontanelle closes by 2 mos 32 1/13/2025 17 Match The Terms ____ Colic ____ Extrusion reflex ____ Grasp reflex ____ Parachute reflex ____ Pincer reflex ____ Prehension ____ Object Permanence A.
