Kaposi [[Sarcoma]] (KS) is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of [[Blood]] and lymph vessels. It usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the [[Mouth]], but it can also develop in other areas like the lungs, [[Liver]], or [[Digestive]] tract. KS is caused by infection with the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi [[Sarcoma]]-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

### Types of Kaposi Sarcoma:
1. **Classic Kaposi [[Sarcoma]]**: Typically occurs in older men of Mediterranean, Eastern European, or Middle Eastern descent. It progresses slowly and usually appears on the lower extremities.
   
2. **Endemic (African) Kaposi [[Sarcoma]]**: Found in certain areas of Africa, this form can affect younger people and tends to be more aggressive.

3. **Epidemic (AIDS-related) Kaposi [[Sarcoma]]**: Associated with HIV infection, this type is more aggressive and can occur at any stage of HIV infection, but is most common in those with severe immunosuppression.

4. **Iatrogenic (Transplant-related) Kaposi [[Sarcoma]]**: Occurs in people who have undergone organ transplants and are on immunosuppressive therapy.

### Symptoms:
- Purplish, red, or brown lesions on the skin or mucous membranes.
- Swelling, particularly in the legs or face, due to blockage of lymphatic vessels.
- Lesions in the [[Digestive]] tract or lungs may cause bleeding or breathing difficulties.

### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis is usually made through a biopsy of the lesions. Imaging studies like X-rays, CT scans, or endoscopy may be used to detect internal lesions.

### Treatment:
Treatment depends on the type and extent of the disease. Options include:
- **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** for HIV-positive patients.
- **Radiation therapy** for localized lesions.
- **Chemotherapy** for more widespread disease.
- **Immunotherapy** in some cases.
- **Surgery** may be used for small, isolated lesions.

Kaposi [[Sarcoma]] can be challenging to treat, particularly in patients with weakened immune systems. Management often involves a combination of therapies to control the disease and maintain quality of life.
