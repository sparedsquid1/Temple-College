The nurse is preparing to administer protamine emergently to a client per instructions from the health care provider. The nurse concludes this is necessary due to an adverse reaction to which drug? A) Clopidogrel B) Heparin C) Alteplase D) Warfarin Answer: B Rationale: An overdosage of any anticoagulant may result in uncontrolled bleeding in the client. In most cases, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to correct overdosage; however, if the bleeding is severe there are antidotes. Protamine is used to treat overdose of heparin and low– molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). Vitamin K is used to treat the overdosage of warfarin. Alteplase and clopidogrel do not require antidotes.

The nurse is monitoring a client who is receiving heparin by continuous IV infusion. Which action should the nurse prioritize? A) Perform a complete blood count. B) Perform baseline PT/INR. C) Perform aPTT test 4–6 hours after injection. D) Perform blood coagulation tests every 4 hours. Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should perform blood coagulation tests every 4 hours for the client receiving heparin by continuous IV infusion. A blood count test or the baseline PT/INR test is not the right intervention for this client. When administering heparin by the subcutaneous route, an aPTT test is performed 4–6 hours after the injection.

A nurse is preparing to administer the first dose of warfarin to a client. Which assessment should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Observe for signs of thrombus formation. B) Assess PT and INR. C) Assess for signs of bleeding. D) Monitor for hypersensitivity reaction. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should assess the prothrombin time (PT) and INR before administering the anticoagulant drug warfarin to the client. Observing for signs of thrombus formation, assessing for signs of bleeding, and monitoring for hypersensitivity reaction are the ongoing assessments performed in clients who are administered warfarin.

The nurse is teaching a client about dietary concerns related to the administration of warfarin. The nurse determines the teaching session is successful when the client correctly points out that a consistent intake of which foods is necessary when using warfarin? A) Dairy products B) Root vegetables C) Green leafy vegetables D) Fruits and cereals Answer: C Rationale: The client should be aware that foods high in vitamin K can affect the effectiveness of warfarin. These foods include leafy green vegetables, beans, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cheese, fish, and yogurt. Increased amounts of vitamin K could decrease the PT/INR and increase the risk of clot formation. Dairy products, root vegetables, fruits, and cereals are generally low in vitamin K. A diet that is very low in vitamin K may prolong the PT/INR and increase the risk of hemorrhage. The key to vitamin K management for clients receiving warfarin is maintaining a consistent daily intake of vitamin K. To avoid large fluctuations in vitamin K intake, clients receiving warfarin should be aware of the vitamin K content of food.

A nurse is conducting an assessment on a client who has recently undergone exploratory laparotomy. The nurse notes the continued order for enoxaparin. The nurse predicts this is to accomplish which goal? A) Repair damage to a blood vessel B) Prevent formation of a blood clot C) Encourage cessation of bleeding D) Prevent coagulation cascade Answer: B Rationale: This client has an increased risk for DVT and PE related to the major abdominal surgery. Enoxaparin is given subcutaneously prophylactically to help prevent the formation of a thrombus or blood clot. A thrombus refers to the formation of a blood clot, sometimes from damage, in a vessel that impedes blood flow. Cessation of bleeding refers to hemostasis. The coagulation cascade is the series of events that occur in the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding. Hemostasis and the coagulation cascade are normal processes in the body.

A nurse is assessing a client who is prescribed warfarin and notes a positive occult blood screen, petechiae on both legs, and blood-tinged toothbrush. The nurse anticipates the health care provider will prescribe which antidote to counteract these findings? A) Phytonadione B) Protamine C) Ticlopidine D) Tenecteplase Answer: A Rationale: This client is showing signs and symptoms of warfarin overdosage, which includes melena, petechiae, oozing from superficial injuries, such as cuts from shaving or bleeding from the gums after brushing the teeth, or excessive menstrual bleeding. These adverse reactions should be reported immediately to the health care provider so the proper antidote, phytonadione (vitamin K), can be ordered. Heparin overdosage is treated with protamine. Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet drug, and tenecteplase, a thrombolytic, would have no effect on counteracting the effects of warfarin.

The nurse is scheduled to administer the following medications at 0900: heparin subcutaneous, cefazolin IVPB, and atenolol PO. The morning labs are platelets 150,000 mcL, WBC 10,000 mcL, and APTT 100 seconds. Which is the nurse's priority in this situation? A) Place the client in supine position with legs elevated for BP 88/50 mm Hg. B) Instruct client to use an electric razor and soft toothbrush. C) Call primary care provider with APTT, BP 88/50 mm Hg, and recent void of red urine. D) Determine if there has been an improvement in the infection. Answer: A Rationale: All the listed medications can interact with heparin, and increase the risk for bleeding. The nurse should place the client in supine position with legs elevated since the client is hypotensive, BP 88/50 mm Hg. Placing a client in this position will help increase the blood pressure by increasing the return of blood to the heart. Next, the nurse should call the primary care provider (PCP) about the abnormal APTT, BP 88/50 mm Hg, and the recent void of red urine. The PCP will provide orders regarding whether to hold heparin or administer a reduced dose of the anticoagulant later, and what to do about the atenolol since the blood pressure is low, and may order follow-up labs, hemoglobin and hematocrit, and urinalysis for blood. The other actions are appropriate when caring for a client receiving the list of medications listed, but are not as important considering that the client may be bleeding. When a client receives anticoagulation, the nurse should instruct the client to use an electric razor, and a soft toothbrush to decrease the risk for bleeding. The client is taking an antibiotic, so the nurse should determine if there is an improvement in the infection. The client should have body temperature return to normal, and a decrease in the white blood count, and the symptoms of the infection improve and disappear.

The nurse educates a client diagnosed with atrial fibrillation about the prescribed warfarin. Which client statements establish the need for further clarification? A) “I will keep my lab appointments for a prothrombin and INR levels.” B) “I will take the warfarin the same time each day.” C) “I will not eat green leafy vegetables, broccoli, yogurt, or cheese.” D) “I will not drink alcohol unless alright with my primary care provider.” Answer: C Rationale: The nurse needs to clarify teaching regarding the intake of foods rich in vitamin K. The client should not avoid eating foods with vitamin K, but eat consistent amounts every day so therapeutic levels for the warfarin may be maintained. The client has an adequate understanding of the importance of keeping lab appointments for PT and INR levels used to monitor and regulate the warfarin dosage. The client should take the warfarin the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels of the drug. The client should not drink alcohol unless the primary care provider approves it and instructs the client as to how much and how often. Alcohol will increase the risk for bleeding.

The nursing instructor is teaching a class about the actions of anticoagulants. The instructor determines the class is successful when the students correctly choose which as action(s) of anticoagulants? Select all that apply. A) Prevent formation of a thrombus B) Prevent extension of a thrombus C) Dissolve existing thrombi D) Thin the blood E) Can reverse the damage caused by a thrombus Answer: A, B Rationale: Anticoagulants can prevent the formation and extension of a thrombus but have no direct effect on an existing thrombus and do not reverse any of the damage from that thrombus. Although clients often refer to anticoagulants as blood thinners, they do not actually thin the blood.

The nurse is preparing to administer an anticoagulant to several clients. The nurse should question this order if which disorder(s) is noted in the client's medical record? Select all that apply. A) Leukemia B) Hypotension C) Atrial fibrillation D) GI ulcers E) Tuberculosis Answer: A, D, E Rationale: Anticoagulants are contraindicated in clients with known sensitivity to the drug, active bleeding (except when caused by DIC), hemorrhagic disease, tuberculosis, leukemia, uncontrolled hypertension, GI ulcers, recent eye or CNS surgery, aneurysms, and severe renal and hepatic disease and during pregnancy and lactation. They are also contraindicated in clients with a hypersensitivity to pork products. Hypotension may be an indication of a hypersensitivity or adverse reaction to argatroban and protamine. Clients with atrial fibrillation are often prescribed anticoagulants to help decrease the risk of thrombus formation.

The nurse is conducting the preadministration assessment on a client with DVT who is prescribed an anticoagulant. Which assessment(s) should the nurse prioritize? Select all that apply. A) Test for a positive Homans sign. B) Examine extremity for skin temperature. C) Assess pain. D) Assess blood pressure. E) Check for pedal pulse. Answer: A, B, C, E Rationale: Preadministration assessment for a client with a DVT should include checking for a pedal pulse, examining the extremity for color and skin temperature, assessing for pain, and checking for a positive Homans sign. The nurse should carefully monitor the blood pressure after administering the anticoagulant as a decided drop in blood pressure or rise in the pulse may indicate internal bleeding and must be reported immediately to the health care provider so emergent treatment can be started.

The nurse is teaching a client about the heparin which has been prescribed for a thrombus formation. Which information should the nurse prioritize in this teaching? Select all that apply. A) Onset of action is almost immediate. B) Maximum effect occurs within 10 minutes. C) It is preferably given intramuscularly. D) Clotting time returns to normal within 4 hours. E) It causes fewer adverse reactions than the oral form. Answer: A, B, D Rationale: Parenteral heparin results in an almost immediate onset of action with a maximum effect within 10 minutes, but clotting returns to normal within 4 hours unless subsequent doses are given. It is preferably given subcutaneously or intravenously. The parenteral form has more potential adverse reactions than the oral form.

The nurse is caring for a postoperative client receiving dalteparin prophylactically to prevent deep vein thrombosis. The nurse should perform which ongoing assessment(s) for safe administration of the drug? Select all that apply. A) Presence of dark tarry stools, or melena B) Presence of pain, edema, redness in leg C) Nasogastric drainage for presence of blood D) Presence of dry mucous membranes E) Ability to transfer from bed to chair Answer: A, B, C Rationale: The nurse assesses for any signs or symptoms of bleeding when safely administering an anticoagulant. The nurse would assess nasogastric secretions for the presence of blood, which could be coffee grounds, or bright red bloody drainage. The nurse would also assess for bowel movements that would suggest bleeding, including dark tarry stools, or melena. The nurse should assess for signs and symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis, which is a sudden onset of pain, redness, and edema in a leg. Assessing the client for dry mucous membranes or the ability to transfer from bed to chair is an important action postoperatively, but unrelated to the safe administration of the low–molecular-weight heparin, dalteparin.
