Davis Company Laboratory Tests (continued_1) ▪ Composite urine specimen: 24-hour urine • Patient instructed to void and discard urine • Time recorded as the start time of test • Exactly at 24 hours, patient instructed to void • Urine added to collection device and test ends • Incomplete urine collection cause inaccurate results Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Laboratory Tests (continued_2) ▪ Urine culture • Identifies organisms present ‒ Often bacteria • Urine specimen collected before antibiotic given • Sensitivity test identifies antibiotic that will destroy bacteria Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Laboratory Tests (continued_3) ▪ Renal function tests • Serum creatinine • Blood urea nitrogen • Serum uric acid • Creatinine clearance test • Glomerular filtration rate Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Contrast-Induced Nephropathy ▪ Contrast nephrotoxic • Can result in acute kidney injury • See rise in serum creatinine • Patient asymptomatic ▪ Risk factors • Azotemia • Low G F R • Diabetes mellitus • Renal impairment • Nephrotoxic drugs Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Renal Biopsy ▪ Provides information about kidney disease ▪ Small section of renal cortex obtained for analysis through flank incision ▪ Contraindications • Bleeding tendencies • Uncontrolled hypertension • Solitary kidney Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Radiological Studies ▪ Kidneys-ureter-bladder x-ray • Tumors • Swollen kidneys • Kidney stones Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Radiological Studies (continued_1) ▪ Pyelogram • Imaging of renal pelvis, calyces, ureter • Types ‒ I V: Contrast-injected I V, serial x-rays show contrast as it is cleared from blood by kidneys ‒ Retrograde: Introduction of contrast through ureter ‒ Antegrade: Contrast introduced by percutaneous needle puncture into renal pelvis Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Radiological Studies (continued_2) ▪ I V pyelogram • Check allergies prior to test. • Check creatinine levels prior to contrast media. • Hydration before and after • I V contrast media injected • Contrast media outlines renal structures. Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company I V Pyelogram Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Radiological Studies (continued_3) ▪ Renal angiography • Check allergies prior to testing. • Check creatinine, G F R prior to contrast media. • Dye visualizes renal arteries. • Post-test check distal pulses and dressings. Copyright ©2019 F.A. Davis Company Endoscopic Procedures ▪ Cystoscopy and pyelogram • Surgery ‒ Cystoscope inserted in bladder through urethra • Retrograde pyelogram ‒ Contrast media injected into kidney pelvis • X-rays taken • Monitor urine output postprocedure Copyright ©2019 F.A.
