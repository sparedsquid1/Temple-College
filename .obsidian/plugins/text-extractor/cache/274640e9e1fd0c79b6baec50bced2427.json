A client has been prescribed pyridostigmine for myasthenia gravis. The nurse would be alert for the development of which adverse reaction following the administration? A) Seizure disorder B) Reduction of visual acuity C) Abdominal discomfort D) Cardiac arrhythmias Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should monitor for cardiac arrhythmias as a general adverse reaction in the client. Seizure disorder, reduction of visual acuity, and abdominal discomfort are not pyridostigmine-related adverse reactions. Reduction of visual acuity is related to topical ophthalmics. When the client is receiving bethanechol for urinary retention, the nurse needs to examine for abdominal discomfort, which is an adverse reaction of bethanechol and not pyridostigmine. Seizures are a potential adverse reaction with lithium toxicity.

A client with urinary retention is prescribed bethanechol. The nurse will administer this cautiously if which disorder is noted in the client's medical record? A) Raynaud disease B) Bradycardia C) Coronary artery disease D) Hyperthyroidism Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should administer bethanechol cautiously if a client has bradycardia, hypertension, epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, recent coronary occlusion, or megacolon. Individuals with coronary artery disease and hyperthyroidism should not receive bethanechol as it is contraindicated. Individuals with Raynaud disease should not receive alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs.

A client was emergently administered bethanechol. Which finding on ongoing assessment should the nurse prioritize and notify the health care provider immediately? A) Failure to void B) Frequent emesis C) Increased abdominal pain D) Hematuria Answer: A Rationale: Bethanechol is used to treat acute nonobstructive urinary retention. The nurse should notify the primary health care provider if the client fails to void after drug administration. Nausea, emesis, and increased abdominal pain are adverse effects of bethanechol. Hematuria is s potential adverse reaction to sulfasalazine, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).

The nurse is preparing a teaching plan for a client and caregiver concerning the cholinergic drug therapy that has been prescribed. Which teaching point should the nurse prioritize? A) Instructions to avoid fiber-rich food during therapy B) Importance of adopting a self-monitoring blood pressure program C) Review of the purpose of the drug therapy with the client and family D) Evaluation of the client's previous history of disorders Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should review the purpose of the drug therapy with the client and family when developing a teaching plan for a client receiving outpatient therapy with a cholinergic drug. Diarrhea is a potential adverse reaction for which eating fiber may help counteract. These drugs should be used cautiously in clients with a history of hypertension, so the client may already be accomplishing this goal. The nurse should include the client's previous history in the preadministration assessment and not at this later time.

The nurse administers bethanechol to a client with urinary retention at 9:30 a.m. The nurse would notify the primary health care provider if the client has not voided by which time? A) 11:30 a.m. B) 10 a.m. C) 10:30 a.m. D) 11 a.m. Answer: D Rationale: When bethanechol is administered orally, the client should void within 30–90 minutes. Therefore, if the client has not yet voided by 11 a.m.., the nurse should notify the primary health care provider. Question format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 25 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 311, Managing Urinary Retention 8. A client with myasthenia gravis who is prescribed pyridostigmine comes to the emergency department reporting abdominal cramping, excessive diarrhea, and severe muscle weakness. The nurse would suspect which situation is occurring? A) Underdosage of the drug B) Tolerance to the drug C) Cholinergic crisis D) Underlying infection Answer: C Rationale: Cholinergic crisis (cholinergic drug toxicity) symptoms include severe abdominal cramping; diarrhea; excessive salivation; muscle weakness, rigidity, and spasms; and clenching of the jaw. Signs of drug underdosage are signs of the disease itself, namely, rapid fatigability of the muscles, drooping of the eyelids, and difficulty breathing. Tolerance would be indicated by a reduction in the adverse reactions to the drug that the client was experiencing. There is no information to suggest that the client has an underlying infection.

A client is reporting diarrhea, rigidity, and spasm after receiving pyridostigmine. Which medication is appropriate to suggest to the prescriber? A) Alprazolam B) Morphine sulfate C) Atropine D) Loperamide Answer: C Rationale: The client is exhibiting a cholinergic crisis. An antidote of atropine 0.4– 0.6 mg intravenously should be administered. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and it is not indicated. Morphine sulfate is an opioid and the client is not having pain. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal, but the reported adverse effects identify a cholinergic crisis and not a medication to just treat the diarrhea.

A client diagnosed with myasthenia gravis is being discharged home after a crisis. Which should be included in the teaching plan? A) Teach the client to adjust the dosage based on their needs. B) Explain that no modification of the drug therapy is encouraged. C) Instruct the family to withhold the medication if they feel it is necessary. D) Identify strategies to cope with the depression associated with the disease. Answer: A Rationale: Clients with myasthenia gravis learn to adjust their drug dosage according to their needs because dosage needs may vary slightly from day to day. Teach the client and family members to feel confident in recognizing symptoms of over- and underdosage, as well as what steps the primary health care providers wishes them to take if either occurs. The dosage regimen is explained and instruction is given in how to adjust the dosage upward or downward.

Which nursing diagnosis is most likely related to the treatment of myasthenia gravis? A) Pain B) Diarrhea C) Infection D) Respiratory complications Answer: B Rationale: Documentation of adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea is associated with a cholinergic response. Pain, infection, and respiratory complications are not associated with myasthenia gravis. Question format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 25 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 311, Nursing Diagnosis 14. A nursing instructor is preparing a class for a group of nursing students about cholinergic drugs. When describing the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which fact(s) would the instructor most likely include about this enzyme? Select all that apply. A) Makes the parasympathetic nervous system function differently B) Inactivates the neurotransmitter serotonin C) Activates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine D) Inactivates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine E) Results in the prevention of nerve synapses to continue nerve impulses Answer: A, E Rationale: Acetylcholinesterase makes the parasympathetic nervous system function differently by inactivating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby preventing the nerve synapse from continuing the nerve impulse. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine or dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs or DNRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin. SNRIs and DNRIs also block norepinephrine. Cholinergic drugs activate the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

A nurse determines a nursing diagnosis of diarrhea is applicable for a client receiving cholinergic drug therapy. Which nursing action(s) will the nurse prioritize in the care plan? Select all that apply. A) Ensure that the client has readily available access to the bathroom. B) Evaluate the number, frequency, and consistency of the stools. C) Contact the primary health care provider for an order to switch to another cholinergic drug. D) Limit the client's fluid intake to 1000 mL per day. E) Maintain the client on strict bed rest. Answer: A, B Rationale: When a cholinergic drug is administered, the client may experience diarrhea. This reaction will continue until tolerance develops, usually within a few weeks. Until tolerance develops, the nurse needs to ensure that proper facilities, such as a bedside commode, bedpan, or bathroom, are readily available. The client is encouraged to ambulate to assist in the passing of flatus. If needed, a rectal tube may be used to assist in the passing of flatus. The nurse should document fluid intake and output and track the number, consistency, and frequency of stools if diarrhea is present. Since diarrhea occurs with any cholinergic drug, switching to another would be of no help. The client needs to replace fluids lost with diarrhea, so limiting fluid intake would be inappropriate. Ambulating to assist with the passage of flatus would be appropriate, while strict bed rest would not be necessary.

After teaching a group of nursing students about the parasympathetic nervous system, the instructor determines that the teaching was successful when the students correctly choose which as an action(s)? Select all that apply. A) Decreased salivary gland production B) Vasodilation C) Increased peristalsis D) Bronchodilation E) Pupillary constriction Answer: B, C, E Rationale: Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in the opposite reactions to those triggered by the adrenergic system: blood vessels dilate, sending blood to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; secretions and peristalsis are activated and salivary glands increase, not decrease, production; the heart slows and pulmonary bronchioles constrict, not dilate; the smooth muscle of the bladder contracts; and the pupils of the eyes constrict.

A nurse is assessing a client prior to giving a cholinergic drug for treatment of urinary retention. Which nursing assessment(s) should be completed prior to administration of a cholinergic? Select all that apply. A) Document pain assessment. B) Administer antiemetic medication. C) Assess blood pressure and pulse rate. D) Palpate the abdomen in the pelvic area. E) Scan the bladder to determine if urine retention is present. Answer: C, D, E Rationale: If a client receives a cholinergic drug for the treatment of urinary retention, palpate the abdomen in the pelvic area and scan the bladder to determine if urine retention is present. A rounded swelling over the pelvis usually indicates retention and distended bladder. The client may also report discomfort in the lower abdomen. Take and document the client's blood pressure and pulse rate. The medication is not for pain; therefore, a pain assessment is not warranted. The client is not reporting nausea and an antiemetic medication is not warranted.
