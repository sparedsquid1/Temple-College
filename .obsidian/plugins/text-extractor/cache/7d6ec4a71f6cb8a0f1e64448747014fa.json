The health care provider has prescribed spironolactone for a client. The nurse is prepared to carefully monitor the client's potassium level if the client is also administered which drug? A) Lisinopril B) Metoprolol C) Terazosin D) Diltiazem Answer: A Rationale: Spironolactone when given with ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) can lead to hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is not associated with the combination of spironolactone and metoprolol, terazosin, or diltiazem. The three drugs are all used to treat hypertension, which may include the use of a diuretic as well.

A client with cerebral edema is prescribed mannitol. Which assessment should the nurse prioritize during the ongoing assessment? A) Blood pressure every 4 hours B) Response of pupils to light C) Joint pain D) Serum uric acid concentrations Answer: B Rationale: When caring for a client who has been given mannitol for intracranial pressure, the nurse should perform neurologic assessments such as response of the pupils to light, level of consciousness, or response to a painful stimulus at the time intervals ordered by the primary health care provider. The nurse monitors the client for joint pain and other discomforts when the client is administered thiazide diuretics for renal impairment. When caring for clients taking thiazide diuretics, the nurse also monitors the serum uric acid concentrations because these drugs may precipitate an acute attack of gout. The nurse needs to monitor the client's blood pressure every 30â€“60 minutes when caring for a client receiving the osmotic diuretic mannitol or urea for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure caused by cerebral edema.

A nurse is preparing a teaching plan for a client with edema who is prescribed a diuretic. Which teaching should the nurse prioritize? A) Decrease fluid intake. B) Gradually increase the dosage. C) Administer early in the day. D) Encourage exercise. Answer: C Rationale: The drug should be administered early in the day to prevent any nighttime sleep disturbance caused by increased urination. Asking the client to decrease fluid intake may contribute to fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The drug should be used as directed without the client making any adjustments to the dosage. The client should remain as active as possible, depending on their overall condition; however, exercise is not a priority in this situation.

A client with a history of seizures is admitted to the unit with pulmonary edema. After administering furosemide, which assessment should the nurse prioritize after discovering the client is also prescribed phenytoin? A) Increased risk of bleeding B) Decreased diuretic effectiveness C) Increased blood glucose levels D) Increased seizure episodes Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should monitor for decreased diuretic effectiveness in the client as the effect of the interaction between furosemide and hydantoins. When the client is administered loop diuretics with anticoagulants or thrombolytics, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Increased blood glucose may occur when thiazide diuretics are given with antidiabetic drugs. Decreased effectiveness of hydantoins, such as manifested by increased seizure activity, is not known to occur as a result of the effect of the interaction between furosemide and hydantoins, and so the nurse need not monitor for the same in the client.

A health care provider prescribes diuretic therapy to a client with nephrotic syndrome. The nurse suspects that the client is hyponatremic based on which assessment finding? A) Paresthesias B) Tremors C) Visual hallucination D) Tachycardia Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should monitor for tachycardia, cold and clammy skin, confusion, and hypotension in the client experiencing hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is excessive loss of sodium and is a common fluid and electrolyte imbalance associated with diuretic therapy. Tremors, visual hallucinations, and paresthesias are the symptoms of hypomagnesemia and not hyponatremia. Question format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 32 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Physiological Adaptation Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 409, Box 32.1 Signs and Symptoms of Common Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance Associated with Diuretic Therapy 6. The nurse is preparing to teach a client with renal insufficiency about the recently prescribed bumetanide for hypertension. Which instruction should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Avoid salt substitutes containing potassium. B) Avoid over-the-counter drugs for cold symptoms. C) Always take the drug before meals. D) Omit the drug dose when feeling dizzy. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to avoid medications that increase blood pressure, such as OTC drugs for appetite suppression and cold symptoms. The nurse should instruct clients taking potassium-sparing diuretics, not loop diuretics such as bumetanide, to refrain from using salt substitutes containing potassium. The nurse need not instruct the client to take the drug before meals since doing so will not decrease the client's blood pressure. The nurse should instruct the client to observe caution while driving or performing hazardous tasks when dizziness or weakness occurs. In such cases, the nurse instructs the client to rise slowly from a sitting or lying position and avoid standing in one place for an extended time.

A nurse is preparing to administer spironolactone to a client. The nurse would question this order if which disorder is noted in the client's history? A) Hyperkalemia B) Liver disease C) Gout D) Diabetes Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should know that potassium-sparing diuretics are contraindicated in clients with hyperkalemia and are not recommended for children. Potassium-sparing diuretics should be used cautiously in clients with liver disease, diabetes, or gout.

A client with congestive heart failure and currently administered digoxin is now prescribed indapamide for edema. Which intervention should the nurse prioritize? A) Encourage oral fluids at frequent intervals during waking hours. B) Encourage the client to eat or drink between meals and in the evening. C) Frequently monitor the client's pulse rate and rhythm. D) Closely monitor the client for signs of hyperkalemia. Answer: C Rationale: Clients receiving a diuretic, particularly a loop or thiazide diuretic such as indapamide, and a digitalis glycoside concurrently require frequent monitoring of the pulse rate and rhythm because of the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. Any significant changes in the pulse rate and rhythm are immediately reported to the primary health care provider. The nurse should encourage oral fluids at frequent intervals during waking hours when caring for older clients to prevent a fluid volume deficit. In such cases, the nurse should also encourage elderly clients to eat or drink between meals and in the evening. The nurse must closely observe clients receiving a potassium-sparing diuretic for signs of hyperkalemia, a serious and potentially fatal electrolyte imbalance.

A nurse administers chlorothiazide to a client with renal compromise. Which action should the nurse prioritize after noting the BUN level is rising? A) Give prescribed magnesium supplements. B) Withhold the next dose of the drug. C) Administer the drug in a diluted form. D) Increase the fluid intake for the client. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should withhold the drug or discontinue its use if the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) rises in the client with renal compromise who is receiving a thiazide diuretic. Magnesium supplements or add-ons may be provided to clients taking loop diuretics as they are prone to magnesium deficiency. The nurse should encourage fluid intake to prevent a fluid volume deficit in elderly clients who are particularly prone to fluid volume deficit and electrolyte imbalances when taking a diuretic. The nurse need not administer the drug in a diluted form since doing so will not have an effect on the blood urea nitrogen level.

A primary health care provider has prescribed a loop diuretic for hypertension in a client with diabetes mellitus. Which assessment should the nurse prioritize? A) Sudden pain in the joints B) Increased blood glucose levels C) Occurrence of gout attacks D) Sudden increase in weight Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should monitor for increased blood glucose levels in the client with diabetes receiving a loop diuretic. The blood glucose levels may be elevated or urine may test positive for glucose. Thiazide diuretic agents may cause gout attacks and sudden joint pain. The nurse need not monitor for a sudden increase in weight as the administration of loop diuretics to a client with diabetes will not cause this. The weight should decrease as the client loses fluid.

A nursing instructor is teaching a class on the actions of the different classes of diuretics. Which drug(s) will the instructor point out as exerting action on the loop of Henle and distal and proximal tubules? Select all that apply. A) Chlorothiazide B) Furosemide C) Bumetanide D) Mannitol E) Spironolactone Answer: B, C Rationale: Loop diuretics, such as furosemide and bumetanide, cause dieresis by inhibiting reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the distal and proximal tubules and in the loop of Henle. Thiazide and related diuretics such as chlorothiazide inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the ascending portion of the loop of Henle and the early distal tubule of the nephron. Osmotic diuretics such as mannitol increase the density of the filtrate in the glomerulus. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone work by blocking the reabsorption of sodium in the kidney tubules.

A nurse is administering amiloride to several clients. The nurse should prioritize monitoring the serum potassium levels for clients with which noted disorder(s)? Select all that apply. A) Diabetes B) Hypertension C) Renal disease D) Epilepsy E) Asthma Answer: A, C Rationale: Hyperkalemia may occur with the administration of potassium-sparing diuretics such as amiloride. It is most likely to occur in clients with an inadequate fluid intake and urine output, those with diabetes or renal disease, the elderly, and those who are severely ill. Many diuretics are used in the treatment of hypertension. Acetazolamide a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor can be used in the treatment of epilepsy. Some thiazide diuretics contain tartrazine that may cause an allergic-type reaction or bronchial asthma in clients who have a hypersensitivity to tartrazine.
