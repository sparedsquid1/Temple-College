### **Summary of Chapter 26: Care of a Child with a Cardiovascular Disorder**

#### **Fetal Circulation**

- Develops between the **3rd and 8th week of gestation**.
- **Foramen ovale**: Shunts blood from the **right atrium to the left atrium**, bypassing the lungs.
- **Ductus arteriosus**: Moves blood from the **pulmonary artery into the aorta**.
- **Ductus venosus**: Bypasses the **liver**, directing blood from the placenta to the inferior vena cava.

---

### **Signs Indicating Possible Cardiac Disorders in Children**

- **Failure to thrive (FTT)**
- **Cyanosis, pallor**
- **Neck vein pulsations**
- **Tachypnea, dyspnea**
- **Irregular pulse rate**
- **Clubbing of fingers (chronic hypoxia)**
- **Fatigue during feeding**
- **Excessive sweating, especially on the forehead**

---

### **Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)**

**Causes:**
- **Prenatal infections** (e.g., rubella in the 1st trimester)
- **Maternal factors**: Alcoholism, diabetes, irradiation, certain drug intake, malnutrition, advanced maternal age.

#### **Types of Heart Defects**

1. **Increased Pulmonary Blood Flow Defects** (Left to right shunting)
    - **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**: May be mild, detected through a murmur.
    - **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)**: Common heart anomaly, loud murmur.
    - **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)**: Oxygenated blood recirculates to lungs.
2. **Obstructive Defects**
    - **Coarctation of the Aorta**: Narrowing of the aorta, leading to **hypertension and CHF if untreated**.
3. **Decreased Pulmonary Blood Flow Defects**
    - **Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)**: Four defects (pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, overriding aorta, VSD). Causes cyanosis, clubbing, and "tet spells."
4. **Severe Defects**
    - **v (HLHS)**: Underdeveloped left side of the heart, fatal without early treatment.

# **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

### **1. A newborn with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) is likely to exhibit which symptom?**

- **A. Cyanosis**
- **B. Loud, harsh systolic murmur**
- **C. Hypotension**
- **D. Bradycardia**

**Answer: B. Loud, harsh systolic murmur**  
**Rationale**: A large VSD results in increased blood flow to the lungs, leading to a **loud murmur** but not cyanosis unless pulmonary hypertension develops.

---

### **2. Which cardiac defect is characterized by four structural anomalies?**

- **A. Atrial Septal Defect**
- **B. Coarctation of the Aorta**
- **C. Tetralogy of Fallot**
- **D. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome**

**Answer: C. Tetralogy of Fallot**  
**Rationale**: TOF consists of **pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, overriding aorta, and VSD**.

---

### **3. Which medication is used to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants?**

- **A. Prostaglandin E1**
- **B. Digoxin**
- **C. Indomethacin**
- **D. Furosemide**

**Answer: C. Indomethacin**  
**Rationale**: **Indomethacin (NSAID)** inhibits prostaglandin production, leading to PDA closure.

---

### **4. A nurse is caring for an infant with coarctation of the aorta. What finding is expected?**

- **A. Equal blood pressure in all extremities**
- **B. Weak femoral pulses and strong upper extremity pulses**
- **C. Cyanosis in all four extremities**
- **D. Tachypnea without pulse changes**

**Answer: B. Weak femoral pulses and strong upper extremity pulses**  
**Rationale**: **Coarctation of the aorta causes a difference in BP between the upper and lower extremities.**

---

### **5. What is a hallmark sign of Kawasaki disease?**

- **A. Persistent high fever unresponsive to antipyretics**
- **B. Hypotension**
- **C. Bradycardia**
- **D. Cyanosis**

**Answer: A. Persistent high fever unresponsive to antipyretics**  
**Rationale**: Kawasaki disease presents with **prolonged fever, rash, and mucosal involvement**.

---

### **6. A nurse is preparing to administer digoxin to an infant. What heart rate would indicate the need to hold the dose and notify the provider?**  
   - **A. 80 bpm**  
   - **B. 90 bpm**  
   - **C. 100 bpm**  
   - **D. 120 bpm**  

   **Answer: C. 100 bpm**  
   **Rationale**: In **infants and young children, digoxin should be withheld if the heart rate is below 100 bpm**, as it may indicate toxicity.  

---

### **7. What is a common sign of congestive heart failure (CHF) in infants?**  
   - **A. Clubbing of the fingers**  
   - **B. Bradycardia**  
   - **C. Poor feeding and failure to thrive**  
   - **D. Hypertension**

   - **A. Loud systolic murmur**  
   - **B. Weak femoral pulses**  
   - **C. Wide pulse pressure and bounding pulses**  
   - **D. Bradycardia**  

   **Answer: C. Wide pulse pressure and bounding pulses**  
   **Rationale**: PDA causes **increased pulmonary circulation**, leading to **bounding pulses and widened pulse pressure** due to blood flow recirculating to the lungs.  

---

### **13. What is a priority intervention for a child experiencing a "tet spell"?**  
   - **A. Administer oxygen**  
   - **B. Place in knee-to-chest position**  
   - **C. Give IV fluids**  
   - **D. Monitor blood pressure**

   - **B. Cyanosis of upper extremities**  
   - **C. Weak femoral pulses and high BP in upper extremities**  
   - **D. Loud diastolic murmur**  

   **Answer: C. Weak femoral pulses and high BP in upper extremities**  
   **Rationale**: Coarctation causes **higher BP in the arms** and **weak pulses in the legs** due to obstructed blood flow.  

---

   - **A. Closure of the ductus arteriosus**  
   - **B. Use of digoxin**  
   - **C. Maintaining an open ductus arteriosus with prostaglandins**  
   - **D. Immediate administration of diuretics**  

   **Answer: C. Maintaining an open ductus arteriosus with prostaglandins**  
   **Rationale**: Prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing some circulation **until corrective surgery or transplant**.  

---
