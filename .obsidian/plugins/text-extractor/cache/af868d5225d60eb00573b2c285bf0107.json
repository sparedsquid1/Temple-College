A nurse is preparing to administer diphenhydramine to a client with bronchial irritation. Which activity should the nurse prioritize during the preadministration assessment? A) Document color and amount of any sputum present. B) Record the previous prescriptions. C) Take vital signs every 4 hours. D) Assess the client's cardiovascular status. Answer: A Rationale: Before drug administration, the nurse should document the color and amount of any sputum present. The nurse need not record the previous prescriptions; however, the nurse should determine if any drugs the client uses would potentially interact with diphenhydramine. The nurse needs to take the client's vital signs, but not every 4 hours. The nurse needs to assess the respiratory status of the client before administering mucolytics and expectorants, but not before administering diphenhydramine HCl. Assessing the client's cardiovascular status is not necessary.

A nurse is conducting an ongoing assessment and notes the client is experiencing difficulty bringing up mucus. Which nursing diagnosis should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Ineffective Airway Clearance B) Acute Pain C) Injury Risk D) Impaired Oral Mucous Membranes Answer: A Rationale: Thick sputum interferes with moving air effectively in and out of the respiratory tract. Therefore, the most likely nursing diagnosis would be Ineffective Airway Clearance. There is no evidence of pain. Injury Risk would be appropriate if the client was experiencing sedation or drowsiness from the prescribed medication. Impaired Oral Mucous Membranes would be appropriate if the client was experiencing dry mouth from the medication.

A client prescribed an antihistamine for vasomotor rhinitis is concerned about the potential increased sedation effects. Which antihistamine can the nurse point out as the best option to help avoid the sedation effects? A) Brompheniramine B) Clemastine C) Chlorpheniramine D) Azelastine Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should assure the client that azelastine has very little sedative effect; it is a second-generation antihistamine with little effect on central nervous system (CNS) depression. Brompheniramine, clemastine, and chlorpheniramine are first-generation antihistamines. Sedation is seen more often with first-generation antihistamines. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 30 Learning Objective: 1, 5 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 369, Respiratory System Reactions 8. The nurse is preparing a teaching session for a client with rhinitis about the prescribed decongestant. Which potential adverse reaction should the nurse point out? A) Decreased pulse rate B) Blurred vision C) Drowsiness D) Dryness of throat Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should inform the client that blurred vision is a possible adverse reaction of decongestant drugs. Additionally, an increased and not decreased pulse rate may also be seen. Drowsiness is not seen with decongestant usage. Dryness of the nasal mucosa and not the throat may be seen with decongestant drugs, which are used mostly as topical sprays and drops. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 30 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 370, Decongestants 9. A client with allergic rhinitis is prescribed an antihistamine. The nurse instructs the client to suck on sugarless hard candy to address which potential adverse reaction? A) Drowsiness and sedation B) Thickening of the bronchial secretions C) Altered sensation of taste D) Dryness of the oral mucosa and the throat Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to suck on a sugarless hard candy to prevent dryness of the oral mucosa and the throat, which is a side effect of antihistamine therapy. Sucking on candy does not relieve drowsiness, sedation, and thickening of the bronchial mucosa seen with antihistamine therapy. Altered sense of taste does not occur with most antihistamines.

The client reports a mild stinging sensation after using a nasal spray decongestant. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? A) “You need to stop the medication immediately.” B) “The dose is probably too strong and needs to be reduced.” C) “This sensation is common and usually disappears with continued use.” D) “We better contact your primary health care provider right away.” Answer: C Rationale: The nurse needs to assure the client that the mild stinging sensation usually disappears with continued use. The drug needs to be stopped only if the stinging sensation is severe. The dose of the medication does not need to be altered. The primary health care provider does not need to be consulted immediately in the presence of a mild stinging sensation.

A client currently prescribed a MAOI for depression is also prescribed a decongestant for cold symptoms. Which potential adverse reaction should the nurse point out will warrant contacting the health care provider? A) Hypotension B) Severe headache C) Sedation D) Bradycardia Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should warn the client of the possibility of severe headache due to an interaction between the two drugs. Such an interaction may also result in hypertensive crisis instead of hypotension. Sedation and bradycardia do not occur when an MAOI and decongestant are used together.

A client presents to the clinic with a cough that is getting worse. The client reports having used over-the-counter dextromethorphan. Which findings on assessment should the nurse prioritize after noting the client is prescribed phenelzine? Select all that apply. A) Hypertension B) Fever C) Nausea D) Constipation E) Sedation Answer: B, C Rationale: Coadministration of dextromethorphan (a nonopioid antitussive) and phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) may result in hypotension, fever, nausea, leg jerking, and coma. Individuals with hypertension should use antihistamines and decongestants cautiously due to potential adverse reactions. Sedation is a potential reaction when MAOIs and antihistamines are taken concomitantly. Constipation is a potential adverse reaction when using codeine and Benzonatate.

The nurse is preparing to administer an antihistamine to a client. Which actions should the nurse prioritize during the preadministration assessment? Select all that apply. A) Ask about symptoms. B) Check visual acuity. C) Ask about prescription medications. D) Auscultate bowel sounds. E) Auscultate heart sounds. Answer: A, C Rationale: The preadministration assessment for clients receiving antihistamines depends on the reason for use but should at the least include asking about symptoms of the involved areas and asking about prescription and over-the-counter medications the client is taking. Assessing the visual acuity and auscultating the bowel and heart sounds are part of the initial general assessment and should already be completed. Preadministration assessments are evaluating specific areas which are or could be affected by the prescribed medication.

When teaching a client about using a decongestant in a nasal spray form, which instruction would the nurse include? Select all that apply. A) “Recline on a bed and hang your head over the edge.” B) “Overuse can make the symptoms return.” C) “Make sure the tip of the container is touching the nasal mucosa.” D) “Do not share the container with anyone except family members.” E) “Know that nasal burning or stinging may occur.” Answer: B, E Rationale: A client should be instructed to administer a nasal spray while sitting upright and, not allow the tip of the container to touch the nasal mucosa. The client may experience some burning or stinging after the administration of the nasal spray. The container should not be shared with anyone. Overuse can make the symptoms worse resulting in rebound congestion. If the burning and stinging become severe, the health care provider should be notified.

The nursing instructor is conducting a teaching session with a group of nursing students analyzing the differences between first- and second-generation antihistamines. The instructor determines the class is successful when the students correctly choose which actions as advantages for administering second generation antihistamines? Select all that apply. A) Less sedation B) Fewer anticholinergic effects C) Less nausea D) Can be used during pregnancy E) Can be used during lactation Answer: A, B Rationale: Second-generation antihistamines cause less sedation and fewer anticholinergic effects because they selectively bind to peripheral rather than central H1 receptors. Some first-generation antihistamines can be used as antiemetics. Use of any antihistamine is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. Question Format: Multiple Select Chapter: 30 Learning Objective: 2 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 368, Antihistamines 25. The nurse has administered an antitussive to an older client. Which findings on assessment should the nurse prioritize? Select all that apply. A) Hearing loss B) Steady gait C) Visual impairment D) Hypertension E) Salivation Answer: A, C Rationale: Older adult clients are more likely to experience injury from dizziness because with age comes an increased risk for falls due to sensorimotor deficits (hearing loss, visual impairment) or unsteady gait. Codeine may cause orthostatic hypotension. Dryness of the mouth would be more of a concern than salivation.
