#### ü©∏ **Chapter 27 Summary: Blood and Lymph Disorders**

### üî¨ **1. Overview of the Hematologic and Lymphatic systems**
- The **hematologic system** includes blood and the organs involved in its production.
- **Blood dyscrasias** refer to conditions where blood components are abnormally formed or their levels are abnormal.
- Blood cell formation begins early in fetal development and initially involves the **yolk sac, liver, spleen**, and **bone marrow**.
- The **lymphatic system** assists in immune defense and fluid balance, including the **spleen**, which filters blood and interacts with lymphocytes.

### ü©ª **2. Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)**
- Most common nutritional deficiency in U.S. children.
- Common during **infancy** and **adolescence** due to growth spurts.
- Caused by reduced red blood cells (RBCs), decreased hemoglobin, or smaller RBCs.

#### Clinical Manifestations:
- Pallor, irritability, poor appetite, decreased activity, overweight infants from excess milk.
- Blood tests show low Hgb, hematocrit, RBC count, and serum iron.

#### Complications:
- Heart failure, growth retardation, cognitive issues if untreated.

#### Treatment:
- **Ferrous sulfate**, **vitamin C**, iron-rich diet, iron supplements like **Imferon**.

### üå°Ô∏è **3. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)**
- Inherited disorder; abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) causes RBCs to sickle.
- **Sickle cell trait** (inherited from one parent) is usually asymptomatic.
- **Sickle cell anemia** (from both parents) causes severe symptoms after 6 months of age.

#### Crises:
1. **Vaso-occlusive crisis**: Pain due to blockage.
2. **Splenic sequestration**: Trapping of blood in spleen.
3. **Aplastic crisis**: Drop in RBC production.
4. **Hyperhemolytic crisis**: Increased RBC destruction.

#### Treatment:
- Pain management, hydration, oxygen, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplant, infection prevention.

---

### üíâ **4. Thalassemia**
- Genetic disorder where abnormal hemoglobin is produced.

#### Minor:
- One gene from one parent; mild anemia.

#### Major (Cooley‚Äôs anemia):
- Inherited from both parents.
- Symptoms begin in infancy: pallor, jaundice, facial changes, hepatomegaly.
- Leads to **severe anemia**, **cardiac failure**, **bone changes**, and **growth delays**.

#### Treatment:
- **Frequent transfusions**, **iron chelators**, **bone marrow transplant**, **splenectomy**, and supportive care.

---

### üß¨ **5. Hemophilia**
- X-linked disorder; affects mostly **males**.
- **Hemophilia A**: Factor VIII deficiency.
- **Hemophilia B**: Factor IX deficiency.

#### Symptoms:
- Abnormal bleeding, hematuria, prolonged PTT, risk of hemorrhage, anemia.

#### Treatment:
- Factor replacement, **DDAVP**, bleeding precautions, no aspirin, **RICE**, MedicAlert bracelet.

---

### ü©∏ **6. Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**
- Autoimmune condition post-viral infection, causing **low platelets**.

#### Signs:
- Bruising, petechiae, nosebleeds, low platelet count (<20,000/mm¬≥).

#### Treatment:
- Corticosteroids (**prednisone**), **IVIG**, transfusions, **splenectomy**, neurologic monitoring, activity restriction.

---

### üß™ **7. Leukemia**
- Cancer of blood-forming tissues; **ALL** most common in children.

#### Symptoms:
- Fatigue, pallor, bleeding, joint pain, organ enlargement, infections.

#### Diagnosis:
- CBC, bone marrow biopsy, liver/kidney function.

#### Treatment:
- Chemotherapy, blood support, infection control, delay vaccines during treatment, education, and emotional support.

---

### üß† **8. Hodgkin‚Äôs Disease**
- Malignancy of the lymphatic system.
- Characterized by **Reed-Sternberg cells**.

#### Symptoms:
- Painless lymph node, night sweats, weight loss, fever, rash.

#### Treatment:
- **Radiation**, **chemotherapy**, symptom management, infection prevention.

---

### üßí **9. Nursing Care for Chronic and Terminal Illness**
- Support growth/development.
- Balance protection with independence.
- Hospice or palliative approach for terminal stages.
- Multidisciplinary care and family support.

# **20 NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**
---

**1.** A child with iron deficiency anemia is prescribed ferrous sulfate. What instruction is most appropriate?
- A. Give with milk
- B. Give with meals
- C. Give with vitamin C
- D. Give on an empty stomach

**Answer:** C  
**Rationale:** Vitamin C enhances iron absorption. Milk inhibits it.

---

**2.** Which symptom indicates sickle cell crisis?
- A. Pale mucous membranes
- B. Painless hematuria
- C. Severe joint pain
- D. Constipation

**Answer:** C  
**Rationale:** Vaso-occlusive crisis presents as severe pain in joints and extremities.

---

**3.** What is the best nursing action during an aplastic sickle cell crisis?
- A. Limit fluids
- B. Encourage activity
- C. Administer oxygen
- D. Transfuse platelets

**Answer:** C  
**Rationale:** Oxygen helps reduce hypoxia during crisis.

---

**4.** Which condition is an X-linked recessive disorder?
- A. Sickle cell anemia
- B. Hemophilia
- C. Thalassemia major
- D. Leukemia

**Answer:** B  
**Rationale:** Hemophilia is X-linked and mainly affects males.

---

**5.** A child with thalassemia major is receiving frequent transfusions. What complication should the nurse monitor for?
- A. Hypernatremia
- B. Iron overload
- C. Hemorrhage
- D. Vitamin B12 deficiency

**Answer:** B  
**Rationale:** Iron accumulates due to repeated transfusions; chelation is required.

---

**6.** Which factor is deficient in hemophilia A?
- A. Factor IX
- B. Factor VII
- C. Factor VIII
- D. Fibrinogen

**Answer:** C  
**Rationale:** Hemophilia A is due to factor VIII deficiency.
