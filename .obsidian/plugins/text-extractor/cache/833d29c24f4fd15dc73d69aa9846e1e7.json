Drug reference should always be used • Determine safe amount time to give medication IV push is NOT within the scope of the LVN Role for LVN: Awareness of drugs to observe for effects Heparin Infusions National Safety Goal ◦ Reduce harm associated with anticoagulant therapy. Heparin infusion rates are adjusted by the RN ◦ Based on the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) Nursing students should not ◦ Adjust the dosage ◦ Change the pump settings of heparin infusions Monitor for signs of bleeding ◦ Bruising ◦ Bleeding of gums ◦ Blood in the stool Central Venous Catheters Ends in superior vena cava or right atriu When peripheral sites are inadequate Delivers all type of solutions, medications, blood, blood products, irritant medications May be left in place for 6 to 8 weeks May be tunneled or nontunneled Correct placement is verified by x-ray Devices can have • One-three lumens in catheter • One or more port chambers • Each lumen exit-called a tail Multi-lumen allow • Simultaneous administration of solutions • Preventing mixing or incompatible solutions Central Venous Access Devices- Types Types ◦ Non-Tunneled Central Catheter ◦ Tunneled Catheter ◦ PICCs ◦ Ports ◦ Hypodermoclysis Non-Tunneled versus Tunneled Non-Tunneled: Accessed directly into vessel Tunneled: Accessed away from vessel and \"tunneled\" under skin to vessel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kmex3fD4BM Central venous catheter CVC peripherally inserted central catheter PICC medical animation Non tunneled Central Catheters Inserted DIRECTLY into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein Short-term 7 days to few weeks Can be inserted at bedside or outpatient setting Tunneled Catheters When access is needed for months to years Device has cuff- anchors in place, prevents bacteria migrating to catheter tip Catheter placed in superior vena cava Advantages • Catheter break can be repaired Disadvantages: • Weekly site care • Cost Maintenace supplies • Effect body image https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVebbriPQAs Ports Reservoir surgically implanted in pocket • Created under skin • Usually in upper chest Catheter attached to • Reservoir • Tunneled under skin • Superior vena cava Can be left unused for long periods of time Used for • Chemotherapy • Antibiotics tissue toxic Accessed usually by • Specially trained RN Requires • Hubert needle: Non- corning needle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63W-haF-zr8 PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) Inserted in basilic or cephalic vein of upper arm-advanced as far as the superior vena cava Can be tunneled or non-tunneled Used for therapy lasting more than 2 weeks Often used in children or adults requiring ◦ High flow of blood ◦ Home IV therapy Avoid taking blood pressures in the arm with PICC! Hypodermoclysis Administration of fluids in subcutaneous tissue ◦ Absorbs by capillaries and lymphatic system Pediatrics, palliative and hospice Treat dehydration: ◦ Safe, low risk, cost effective and option for poor vein quality Administration rate is approximately 1ml/minute Locations: abdomen, thighs, upper arms, check and scapula Complications of IV Therapy Hematoma Phlebitis Infiltration Extravasation Complications of IV Therapy: Hematoma Signs and symptoms: ◦ Swelling ◦ Resistance during flushing ◦ Ecchymoses (discoloration skin from bleeding- bruising) Treatment: ◦ Remove IV ◦ Elevate extremity ◦ Apply cold compress ◦ Do not massage site! ◦ Do not apply warm compress! Complications of IV Therapy: Phlebitis Signs and symptoms: • Redness • Warmth • Swelling • Pain • Hardness of vein Treatment: • Discontinue IV • Apply cold compress initially than warm • Consult RN and Provider Complications of IV Therapy: Infiltration Occurs infusion fluid outside of vein, leaking into tissues Signs and Symptoms: ◦ Edema ◦ Skin blanching ◦ Skin Cool ◦ Swollen ◦ Fluid leaking from site What to do: Stop infusion! Discontinue the site and establish a new one Fluid usually reabsorbs within 24 hours Complications of IV Therapy: Extravasation Caused from infiltration Damage can result in infection, disfigurement, loss of function Signs and symptoms: Pain Edematous Cool to touch Treatment: Be cautious of medications have vesicant (irritating) properties STOP the infusion immediately! Do not remove the catheter-may need administer antidote into tissue Notify RN and Provider immediately Potassium Infusion Potassium is ALWAYS diluted in fluid! Potassium is ALWAYS given as a carefully controlled infusion. Potassium is NEVER given as a bolus! Incorrect administration of Potassium can be FATAL!!!! Complications of IV Therapy Septicemia Circulatory (fluid) Overload Embolism Speed Shock Drug-Solution Incompatibility Complications of IV Therapy: Septicemia (Bloodstream Infection) Occurs pathogens introduced into bloodstream Can occur from breaks in sterile technique during cannula insertion or time system is opened to change the bag or tubing Signs and symptoms: fever, chills, pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue ◦ At site: ◦ Warmth ◦ Redness ◦ Painful ◦ Vein is NOT hard or swollen Blood cultures ordered and aggressive antibiotic therapy is started IV site is immediately discontinued Complications of IV Therapy-Circulatory Overload (Fluid Overload) ◦ Occurs too much fluid entering body ◦ Signs and symptoms: ◦ Respiratory: ◦ Dyspnea ◦ Crackles ◦ Tachypnea ◦ Moist cough ◦ Cardiovascular: ◦ Tachycardia ◦ Increased B/P ◦ Distended neck veins ◦ Dependent edema Complications of IV Therapy-Fluid Overload- Gerontological Population Regularly assess population for fluid volume excess If noted: ◦ Notify RN ◦ Reduce IV to minimum drip rate (1ml per minute) ◦ Do not discontinue IV ◦ Position to maximize lung expansion ◦ Monitor vital signs, level of consciousness, oxygen saturation, fluid output ◦ Observe following RN IV push of diuretic medications (furosemide) if ordered Complications of IV Therapy- Embolus Catheter embolus ◦ Occurs: a piece of the catheter breaks off, travels in the vein until it lodges Air embolus ◦ Occur: changing bags, opening the line of a subclavian catheter ◦ Caused: gas bubbles in bloodstream, stops flow of blood...causing lack of oxygen and death Complications of IV Therapy-Embolus ◦ Treatment: ◦ CALL FOR HELP! ◦ Place patient in Trendelenburg on left side ◦ Administer oxygen ◦ Monitor vital signs ◦ Notify RN and Provider ◦ Further treatment may include: ◦ CPR ◦ High flow oxygen-hyperbaric oxygen chamber ◦ Surgical aspiration into right atrium Complications of IV Therapy-Speed Shock Occurs fluids administered too rapidly Signs and symptoms: ◦ Dizziness ◦ Tightness of chest ◦ Flushed face ◦ Irregular heartbeat ◦ Loss of consciousness, shock, cardiac arrest Treatment: ◦ Call for HELP! ◦ Notify RN and Provider ◦ Stop infusion immediately ◦ Give antidote or resuscitation medications as ordered Complications of IV Therapy- Drug-Solution Incompatibility ◦ Signs-white precipitates in tubing ◦ Very dangerous! ◦ Treatment: ◦ Stop the infusion! ◦ Flush line with sterile saline ◦ Contact RN and Provider Question...

What is a considerations to take when caring for a PICC line? Question... What is a considerations to take when caring for a PICC line? Do not take blood pressure in arm with PICC Nursing Diagnoses *Deficient fluid volume *Risk for infection r/t invasive procedure *Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than body requirements, related to decreased oral intake Nursing Process - Assessment Verify IV orders Are correct IVFs hanging? Assess infusion frequently and rate! Inform pt to call ASAP if site becomes uncomfortable Assess elder pt for s/s of fluid overload Assessing and Managing IV Therapy Assess: ◦ Rate of the infusion-very important! ◦ Insertion site ◦ Every 1-2 hours during a shift ◦ Patency ◦ Absence of complications ◦ Prescribed rate ◦ Infection ◦ Complaints from the patient ◦ Level of the fluid remaining in the bag ◦ When less than 50 ml are left-hang a new bag Nursing Process -Planning IVF enters circulation immediately Adult adapts best at a steady rate 80 to 250 mL/hour Larger amounts of fluid increase the work of the heart ◦ Fluid overload could lead to CHF Provider generally orders 1000mL to infuse over an 8, 10 or 12 hour period Nursing Process-Evaluation Constant assessment of the patient ◦ Evaluation of the effect of IV therapy relates to the reason it was given Hydration = check for good skin turgor, adequate urine output, and moist mucous membranes TPN = assess patient’s weight gain & monitor blood glucose level Blood = monitor the blood count to see if values improve Monitor for signs/symptoms of transfusion reaction Nursing Process-Evaluation ◦Documentation of IV medication is done on the MAR ◦IV site is assessed every 1 to 2 hours according to agency policy and observations are entered on a flow sheet or in nurses’ notes ◦IV fluid counted as intake and recorded on I&O sheet","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
