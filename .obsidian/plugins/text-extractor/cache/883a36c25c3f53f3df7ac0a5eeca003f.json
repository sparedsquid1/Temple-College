The upper 2 corners of the uterus connect with the fallopian tubes. ▪ During pregnancy the uterus increases in size and contains the Placenta which nourishes the fetus until birth. ▪ Rising oxytocin levels increase uterine contractions to speed up the labor process. ▪ 3 layers of the uterus: External perimetrium, Myometrium, Internal Endometrium. ▪ The Endometrium is a highly vascular mucous membrane, part of which is lost and regenerated with each menstrual cycle. ▪ During pregnancy the endometrium helps form the maternal side of the placenta. o Vagina: Extends from the uterine cervix to the vaginal orifice in the perineum. ▪ After puberty the vaginal mucosa is relatively restraint to infection. ▪ The normal bacterial flora of the vagina creates an acidic pH. o Mammary Glands: Enclosed within the breast and surrounded by adipose tissue. ▪ Mammary glands produce milk after pregnancy ▪ During pregnancy high levels of Progesterone and Estrogen prepare the glands for milk production. ▪ Prolactin causes milk production after pregnancy. ▪ Breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin, which stimulates the release of milk and contraction of the uterine muscle. ❖ Male Reproductive System: o Testes: Necessary for the production of viable sperm ▪ In contrast to oogenesis, once started at puberty, spermatogenesis is constant rather than cyclical process and usually continues throughout life. ▪ LH stimulates the secretion of testosterone, which contributes to the maturation of sperm. o Seminal Vesicles, Prostate Gland & Bulbourethral Glands: ▪ The male reproductive system includes bilateral seminal vesicles and Bulbourethral glands, and Singular prostate. ▪ Alkaline secretions of the male reproductive glands ensure that many sperm remain viable in the acidic environment of the vagina ❖ Aging & The Reproductive Systems: o Menopause: Definite end to reproductive capability. ▪ Having occurred when menses have ceased for 12 months. ▪ It usually occurs between the ages 45-55. ▪ Most men testosterone secretion continues throughout life, as does sperm production. ▪ Most common reproductive problem men experience is an enlarged prostate ❖ Female Reproductive System Data Collection: o Normal Function Baselines For Females: ▪ Knowing about expected functioning of the reproductive system is your best preparation for data collection. ▪ Regular relatively PAIN FREE shedding of the endometrial lining of the uterus is expected throughout puberty through midlife ▪ Educate your patients that intercourse is normally expected to be free of pain and infection. ▪ Pregnancy is expected to last approximately 40 weeks ▪ Physical and psychological sexual characteristics and function, including libido, are expected to be maintained by hormones. ▪ Obtain a health history including number of viable pregnancies, outcomes, and complications. ▪ Make sure your patient feels comfortable talking about these subjects. o Breast Examination: ▪ Palpation: Most important part of a breast examination to confirm the presence of lumps and to locate areas of tenderness. ▪ Mammograms are not always sensitive enough to detect a small percentage of masses compared to what we can examine by palpitation. Chapter 42: Women’s Reproductive Disorders ❖ Benign Breast Disorders: o Cyclic Breast Discomfort: ▪ Swelling, tenderness, and sometimes pain o Mastalgia: “breast pain”; can be related to hormone mediated changes within the breast tissues that prepare them for their potential role of breastfeeding ▪ Treatment: If persistent or severe these symptoms can be treated with oral contraceptives that modify hormone levels or NSAIDS to control pain. o Fibrocystic: Overresponsive of cells in the breast to hormonal stimulation (especially estrogen) can cause long term changes resulting in replacement of normal tissue with fibrous tissue. ▪ Common in women between ages 30-50 ▪ Fibrocystic changes usually subside with menopause o Diagnosis: ▪ Can be identified on palpation ▪ Mammogram or Ultrasound ▪ Biopsy o Treatment: ▪ Treatment is based on presenting symptoms ▪ Often no treatment is needed ▪ May use analgesics, NSAIDs to help reduce discomfort ▪ Herbal remedies: Evening Primrose oil, supplemental vitamin therapy ▪ Limiting fatty foods and Caffeine ▪ Birth control use may help control hormonal changes o Mastitis: Breast infection with inflammation. THIS SHIT SUCKS BALLS!! ▪ Occurs as a result of injury and introduction of bacteria into the breast ▪ This condition usually occurs while breastfeeding o S/S: ▪ The breast usually becomes swollen, hot, red, & painful ▪ An abscess can form o Treatment: ▪ Antibiotics ▪ Incision and draining of abscessed area ▪ NSAIDs ▪ Warm packs ▪ Breast supports to control pain and swelling o Nursing Care & Patient Education: ▪ Educate patient on hand hygiene to prevent spread of infection ▪ If breastfeeding, continue to pump/drain the breast ▪ Mother infant bonding/Infant nutrition ***Nurse tip: To prevent mastitis in breastfeeding, recommend frequent changes in feeding positions to empty all portions of the breast as well as hand hygiene. Also recommend frequent feedings and not restricting the length on feeds. ❖ Malignant Breast Disorders: o Patho & Etiology: ▪ Can arise from the milk-production glands, the ductal system, or the fatty and connective tissues of the breast ▪ Most commonly diagnosed in women ▪ Increase in age ▪ Personal or family history of cancers ▪ High fat diet ▪ High alcohol intake ▪ Early Menarche ▪ Late menopause ▪ First pregnancy after age 30 o S/S: ▪ Lump or thickening of breast tissue or a change in shape or contour of breast can indicate breast cancer. ▪ Tumor can cause dimpling of overlying skin ▪ Retraction of the nipple ▪ Clear or bloody nipple discharge ▪ Swelling ▪ Tenderness ▪ Discoloration of the breast can indicate inflammatory breast cancer (rare but deadly form) o Prevention: ▪ Exercising ▪ Moderating fat & alcohol intake ▪ Nonhormonal methods for birth control & menopausal symptoms ▪ Breastfeeding may reduce risk ▪ Genetic testing o Diagnostic Tests: ▪ Breast self-examination (BSE), Clinical breast examination (CBE) ▪ Mammograms ▪ Biopsy o Staging: ▪ Staging classification 1-4 ▪ Lower numbers indicate less spread of cancer ▪ Higher numbers indicate higher chance of metastasis o Therapeutic Measures: (5 main treatments for breast cancer) ▪ Radiation therapy- Administered externally or internally to attack the rapidly dividing cells of a tumor. Usually used after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence or spread. ▪ Chemotherapy- Kills all rapidly dividing cells, which leads to many side effects. ▪ Hormone therapy- Used to deprive cancer cells of hormones that stimulate their growth. ▪ Targeted therapies/Immunotherapy- Attack specific molecular agents or pathways involved in the development of cancer. (less toxic to normal cells) ▪ Surgeries: - Lumpectomy removes just the tumor and a margin around it. - Mastectomy may be partial removing only part of the breast. - Simple Mastectomy is removing the breast tissue of one or both breasts. - Radical Mastectomy is removing breast tissue, underlying muscle, and surrounding lymph nodes.

Education for patients undergoing Fertility testing: ▪ An understanding and nurturing attitude is VERY important because infertility can cause low self-esteem and relationship problems. ▪ People that have been undergoing long term fertility can easily become discouraged with the process, expenses, especially if it has been ineffective. ▪ Educate patients to keep a precise record of body temperatures, ovulation cycles, and menstrual cycles because hormonal changes cause all these changes. ▪ Assess pulses and blood pressures, and a thorough assessment for checkups and procedures such as endometrial biopsy. ▪ For an endometrial biopsy a pregnancy test should be done before procedure, pain medication should be om hand. *For an endometrial Biopsy have a Vasovagal reaction kit
