The **mesoderm** is the middle layer of the three primary germ layers in the early embryo, and it gives rise to many of the body’s internal structures, especially those related to movement, circulation, and support. The mesoderm forms between the [[Ectoderm]] (outer layer) and [[Endoderm]] (inner layer) during gastrulation.

### **Functions and Derivatives of the Mesoderm**
The mesoderm develops into several important systems and tissues, including:

1. **Musculoskeletal System**:
   - **Muscles**: Skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, and smooth muscles.
   - **Bones**: The skeleton, including bones, cartilage, and connective tissue.
   - **Joints** and ligaments.

2. **Circulatory System**:
   - **[[Heart]]** and [[Blood]] vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries).
   - [[Blood]] cells and the entire **circulatory system**.

3. **Excretory and Reproductive Systems**:
   - **Kidneys** and ureters, as well as part of the bladder.
   - The **gonads** (ovaries and [[testes]]), and reproductive ducts (e.g., fallopian tubes, [[uterus]], vas deferens).

4. **Dermis of the Skin**:
   - The inner layer of the skin (dermis), which lies beneath the [[Ectoderm]]-derived epidermis.

5. **Adrenal Cortex**:
   - The outer part of the adrenal glands.

6. **Connective Tissues**:
   - Tendons, ligaments, and other supportive connective tissues.

7. **[[Lymphatic system]]**:
   - The lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and spleen.

### **Special Structures**:
- **Notochord**: A structure that helps to define the body’s axis and forms part of the early embryonic support structure. It eventually gives rise to parts of the vertebral column.
- **Somites**: Blocks of mesoderm that form along the developing [[neural tube]] and give rise to vertebrae, ribs, and some muscles.

The mesoderm plays a crucial role in developing the body’s structural framework and internal systems like circulation, reproduction, and excretion.
