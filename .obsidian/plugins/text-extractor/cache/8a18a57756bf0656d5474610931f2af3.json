Introduce the components of the nursing process and decision making. 2. Discuss the terms critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and clinical judgment. 3. Discuss the basic principles of setting priorities for nursing care5/11/2023 2 Critical Thinking, Clinical Reasoning, and Clinical Judgment5/11/2023 3 The NLN and Nursing Judgment • Nursing judgment encompasses three processes: • Critical thinking • Clinical judgment • Integration of best evidence into practice • Nurses use these processes to make sound decisions about client care Critical Thinking • Requires careful judgment • Directed, purposeful, mental activity • Creating and evaluating ideas, analyzing data, anticipating problems • Using expansive thinking • Reflecting on experience • Constructing plans • Goal = attain desired outcomes5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 5 Clinical Judgment • Noticing-Collecting data • Collecting data for an accurate and thorough assessment • Affected by what the nurse brings to the situation • Knowledge • Ethical perspective • Expectations • Interpreting -Analyzing data • Analyzing the data to determine the client’s problem(s) • Responding • Taking action based on current evidence to • Prevent • Detect • Resolve the client problem(s). • Reflecting • Nurse thinks about what he or she learned from the situation that can be used in another similar situation5/11/2023 6 Clinical Reasoning • Critical Reasoning is clinical thinking inside the clinical setting. • Skills for Critical Reasoning include • Effective reading • Effective writing • Attentive listening • Effective communication • Think before you speak! • See Box 4.2 p. 535/11/2023 7 The Nursing process • Scientific Method • Scientist's method of thinking & acting to solve problems • Step by step process • Nursing Process • Nurse's method of thinking and acting to solve patient's problems • Step by step process • Goal • Provide safe, client-centered care5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 8 Nursing Process Goals • Explore the client’s health status • Identify actual or potential problems • Determine desired outcomes (goal) • Implement appropriate nursing interventions • Evaluate the intervention; was the goal achieved?5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 9 A: Assessment D: Diagnosis P: Planning I: Implementation E: Evaluation What is the Assessment Step? • Recognizing Cues • Data collecting • Gathering information • What is normal, what is abnormal?5/11/2023 12 What is Nursing Diagnosis? • Based on Evidence • Medical versus Nursing Diagnosis5/11/2023 14 Medical Versus Nursing Diagnosis M E D I C A L N U R S I N G • Based on evidence-based practices • Trained to collect data, analyze data, make diagnosis within scope of practice • Plan goals and interventions to treat identified problem • Examples: Risk for Falls, Activity Intolerance • Chosen Interventions examples: • Monitor vital signs • Educate patient about prescribed diet • Administer prescribed medications • Based on evidence-based practices • Trained to collect data, analyze data, make diagnosis within scope of practice • Plan goals and interventions to treat identified problem • Examples: diabetes, hypertension, pneumonia • Prescribes treatments examples: • Antibiotics • IV therapy • Prescribing diet and medications What is Nursing Diagnosis? • Based on Evidence • Medical versus Nursing Diagnosis5/11/2023 16 Medical Diagnosis: Pneumonia What is Nursing Diagnosis? • Based on Evidence • Medical versus Nursing Diagnosis5/11/2023 17 Nursing Diagnosis: Activity Intolerance related to imbalance between oxygen supply and demands What is Nursing Diagnosis? • Based on Evidence • Medical versus Nursing Diagnosis5/11/2023 18 What is Nursing Diagnosis? • Based on Evidence • Medical versus Nursing Diagnosis5/11/2023 19 What is the Planning Step? • Make solutions to the problem • Set goals to overcome the problem • Set interventions to overcome the problem5/11/2023 20 Outcome Goal: The client will demonstrate an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50%. What is the Implementation Step? • Taking Action • Interventions that help to achieve the goal/outcome • Documenting interventions5/11/2023 21 Interventions: • Gradually increase activity allowing the patient to assist with positioning, transferring and self-care as able, • When getting the patient up, observe for symptoms of intolerance such as nausea, decreased blood pressure, and abnormal vital signs. • Monitor and record the patient's ability to tolerate activity noting pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory pattern, difficulty breathing, and skin color before, during and after activity. What is the Evaluation Step? • Evaluate Outcomes • Assessing response to interventions • Comparing to Goal/Outcome • Was Goal Achieved? • If not, reassess Plan and make necessary changes • Cycle continues5/11/2023 22 Evaluation of Goal/Outcome; Documentation • NURSING DIAGNOSIS: • Activity Intolerance related to imbalance between oxygen supply and demands of client's body. • Observed (Objective data): • Difficulty breathing when walking to kitchen and becoming tired • Stated (Subjective data): • \"I have a hard time breathing when I walk to the kitchen and get really tired\" • As manifested by (signs and/or symptoms that prove the problem.): • Fatigue when walking, labored breathing with walking • Maslow's Hierarchy Priority: • HIGH (Physical need to breathe)5/11/2023 23 Evaluation of Goal/Outcome; Documentation • Goal/Outcome: • The client will demonstrate an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50%. • Each chosen intervention's documentation should include • What the nurse did • How the client/patient responded5/11/2023 24 • Intervention • Gradually increase activity allowing the patient to assist with positioning, transferring and self-care as able, • When getting the patient up, observe for symptoms of intolerance such as nausea, decreased blood pressure, and abnormal vital signs. • Monitor and record the patient's ability to tolerate activity noting pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory pattern, difficulty breathing, and skin color before, during and after activity. Client/Patient Response • Increased client's activity allowing patient to assist with positioning and self-care; Patient tolerated activity without difficulty in breathing or fatigue • Assisted patient in getting up; Patient did not experience nausea, decreased blood pressure, or abnormal vital signs • Monitored patient's ability to tolerate walking activity; Patient's vital signs, breathing, and skin color remained within normal limits before, during and after activity Evaluation of Goal/Outcome; Documentation • Goal/Outcome: • The client will demonstrate an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50%. • The Goal Evaluation should restate the initial goal and whether or not it was or was not achieved. • Evaluation should include statement of either • Goal was achieved OR • Goal was not achieved • If goal was not achieved- statement should reflect new plan • Continue with plan • Revise plan5/11/2023 25 Evaluation of Goal/Outcome; Documentation • Goal/Outcome: • The client will demonstrate an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50% Nurses' Note: 6/15/23 0900 The client demonstrated an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50% today. Goal was met. A. Xenakis, TC SVN 6/15/23 0900 The client did not demonstrate an increased tolerance to the activity of walking from the living room to the kitchen by 50% at 2 weeks of plan implementation. Goal was not met. Continue plan. A. Xenakis, TC SVN5/11/2023 26 Key points to Nursing Process • The nursing process is cyclic. • The components often overlap as the nurse continually assesses and evaluates the effects of actions. • Creating a client care plan involves collaboration with the nurse, the client, and other health team members. The NCSBN • Responsible for the design and content of the registered and practical nursing licensure examinations known as the NCLEX-RN® and NCLEX-PN®5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 30 NCSBN Model • Recognize Cues (What matters most?) • Analyze Cues (What could it mean?) • Prioritize Hypotheses (Where do I start?) • Generate Solutions (What can I do?) • Take Action (What will I do?) • Evaluate Outcomes (Did it help?)5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 31 Principles of setting priorities for nursing care5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 34 Priority Setting • Critical thinking is used to set priorities in client care. • Placing nursing diagnoses or nursing interventions in order of importance • Use Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: • High priority – life threatening problems • Medium – problems that threaten health or coping ability • Low – problem can wait a day or so and will not have a major effect on the client • Consider what will happen if a task is not done on a time? • When all tasks have a high priority & there is no way you can do them alone • Assign tasks to others • Priorities will constantly change. Tips for Critical Thinking • Develop interpersonal skills • Ask for help when needed • Replace “I don’t know” and “I’m not sure” with “I’ll find out.” • Use your resources. • Turn errors into learning opportunities. • We all make mistakes. • They’re steppingstones to maturity and new ideas. • Expect more of yourself and others. • Open your mind, invite creativity, and improve quality.5/11/2023 40 Tips for Critical Thinking • Without a knowledge base about thinking, you are not able to apply self-directed thinking. • Self-directed thinker refers to your ability to understand your thinking, control your thinking processes, and explain your thinking. • As you apply your learning in clinical practice, thinking should become automatic rather than a deliberate step-by- step process. • End goal for implementing a deliberate approach to learning thinking is improved patient outcomes.5/11/2023SAMPLE FOOTER TEXT 41 Key Terms • Clinical judgment • The observed outcome of critical thinking and decision making. It is an iterative process that uses nursing knowledge to observe and access presenting situations, identify a prioritized client concern, and generate the best possible evidence-based solutions in order to deliver safe client care (NCSBN, 2019b). • Clinical problem-solving process (nursing process) • A scientific approach to client care that includes data collection, planning, implementation, and evaluation (NCSBN, 2020). • Clinical reasoning • The process of thinking about a client situation in a specific context while considering client and family concerns. • Critical thinking • Purposeful, informed, outcome-focused thinking that results in evidence-based clinical judgment.
