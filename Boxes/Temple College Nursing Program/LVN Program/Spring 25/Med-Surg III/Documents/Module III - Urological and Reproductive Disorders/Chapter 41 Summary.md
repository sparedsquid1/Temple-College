### **Summary of Chapter 41: Genitourinary and Reproductive System Function and Assessment**

This chapter provides an overview of the structure and function of the genitourinary and reproductive systems, their changes with aging, and the assessment techniques used in clinical practice.

#### **1. Anatomy & Physiology Overview**

- The reproductive system consists of organs responsible for producing gametes (sperm in males, eggs in females) and hormones.
- The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.
- The male reproductive system includes the testes, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and penis.
- The genitourinary system involves the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, playing a role in waste elimination and fluid balance.

#### **2. Effects of Aging on the Reproductive System**

- **Women:** Menopause leads to decreased estrogen production, vaginal atrophy, increased risk of osteoporosis, and urinary incontinence.
- **Men:** Decreased testosterone levels, prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), and reduced sperm production.

#### **3. Assessment of the Female Reproductive System**

- **Subjective Data:** Includes personal history, menstrual cycle, obstetric history (Gravida/Para/Abortions), gynecological history, sexual history, and psychosocial factors.
- **Objective Data:** Includes physical examination of external genitalia, vagina, cervix, uterus, and perineum.
- **Breast Examination:** Includes self-exams, clinical exams, mammography, ultrasound, and MRI for high-risk individuals.
- **Pelvic Examination & Pap Smear:** Screens for cervical cancer and infections.

#### **4. Assessment of the Male Reproductive System**

- **Subjective Data:** Includes medication use, family history, sexual history, and urinary symptoms.
- **Objective Data:** Physical examination includes inspection and palpation of the penis, scrotum, testes, spermatic cord, and lymph nodes.
- **Testicular Self-Examination (TSE):** Recommended for early detection of testicular cancer.
- **Prostate Examination:** Includes digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA testing for prostate cancer screening.

#### **5. Diagnostic Tests for the Reproductive System**

- **Imaging Studies:** Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
- **Laboratory Tests:** Hormone levels, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and fertility tests.
- **Endoscopic Procedures:** Laparoscopy, culdoscopy, colposcopy, and hysteroscopy for examining internal structures.

**Rationale:** Annual screening is recommended for women 45–54, with the option to switch to biennial screening after 55.

**3. What is the best method for a male to screen for testicular cancer?**  
a) Routine PSA testing  
b) Annual pelvic ultrasound  
c) Testicular self-examination (TSE)  
d) Digital rectal examination (DRE)

**Answer:** **c) Testicular self-examination (TSE)**

a) Have the patient drink water  
b) Ask the patient to empty her bladder  
c) Position the patient supine  
d) Administer pain medication

**Answer:** **b) Ask the patient to empty her bladder**  
**Rationale:** A full bladder can cause discomfort and interfere with the procedure.

**5. What is the function of the prostate gland?**  
a) Produce testosterone  
b) Store sperm  
c) Produce seminal fluid  
d) Regulate urinary flow

**Answer:** **c) Produce seminal fluid**  
**Rationale:** The prostate contributes to the production of semen.

**6. What term describes the number of pregnancies a woman has had?**  
a) Gravida  
b) Para  
c) Abortions  
d) Menarche

**Answer:** **a) Gravida**  
**Rationale:** Gravida refers to the total number of pregnancies.

**7. What hormone is responsible for ovulation?**  
a) Estrogen  
b) Progesterone  
c) Luteinizing hormone (LH)  
d) Prolactin

**Answer:** **c) Luteinizing hormone (LH)**  
**Rationale:** LH triggers ovulation.

**8. What diagnostic test is used to assess bone density?**  
a) MRI  
b) Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan  
c) CT scan  
d) Ultrasound

**Answer:** **b) Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan**  
**Rationale:** A DEXA scan is the gold standard for osteoporosis screening.

**9. What is a common sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?**  
a) Increased libido  
b) Decreased urine stream  
c) Testicular pain  
d) Blood in semen

**Answer:** **b) Decreased urine stream**  
**Rationale:** BPH causes urinary retention and weak urine flow.

**10. What is a contraindication for a pelvic exam?**  
a) History of UTIs  
b) Menstruation  
c) Pregnancy  
d) Lack of patient consent

**Answer:** **d) Lack of patient consent**
