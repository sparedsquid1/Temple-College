Pheochromocytoma is a rare type of tumor that develops in the adrenal glands, which are located above the kidneys. These tumors typically originate from the chromaffin cells, which are responsible for producing adrenaline ([[Epinephrine]]) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), [[Hormones]] that regulate [[Heart]] rate, [[Blood]] pressure, and other vital functions.

### Key Points about Pheochromocytoma:
1. **Symptoms**: The excessive production of these [[Hormones]] by the tumor can lead to symptoms such as high [[Blood]] pressure (which can be persistent or episodic), severe headaches, sweating, rapid [[Heart]] rate (tachycardia), palpitations, [[anxiety]], and tremors. Symptoms can occur in sudden episodes or be constant.

2. **Diagnosis**: Pheochromocytoma is diagnosed through a combination of biochemical tests (to measure levels of catecholamines and metanephrines in the [[Blood]] or urine) and imaging studies (such as CT scans, MRI, or nuclear medicine imaging) to locate the tumor.

3. **Treatment**: The primary treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor. Before surgery, patients are typically given medications to control [[Blood]] pressure and [[Heart]] rate. In cases where surgery is not possible or the tumor is malignant and has spread, other treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy may be considered.

4. **Genetic Factors**: Some cases of pheochromocytoma are associated with genetic syndromes like Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and [[Neurofibromatosis]] type 1. [[genetic testing]] may be recommended, especially in younger patients or those with a family history of related conditions.

5. **Prognosis**: The prognosis is generally good if the tumor is benign and can be completely removed surgically. However, if left untreated, the excessive hormone production can lead to severe cardiovascular complications.
