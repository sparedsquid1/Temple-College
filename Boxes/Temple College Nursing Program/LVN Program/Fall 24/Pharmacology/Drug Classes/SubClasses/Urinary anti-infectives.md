### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions are primarily gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and include the following: 
- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 
- Abdominal pain or [[Stomatitis]] 

Other generalized body system reactions include: 
- Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, blurred [[Vision]], weakness, and peripheral neuropathy 
- Rash, pruritus, [[photosensitivity]] reactions, and leg cramps 

When these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are given in large doses, clients may experience burning on urination and bladder irritation; this should not be mistaken for a continued infection. [[nitrofurantoin]] has been known to cause acute and chronic pulmonary reactions. Clients should be told that [[phenazopyridine]] will discolor the urine (dark orange to brown) and permanently stain undergarments that come in contact with the urine.

### Contraindications
Contraindications and Precautions Anti-infectives are contraindicated in clients with a hypersensitivity to the [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and during pregnancy ([[Preg Cat C]]) and lactation. One exception is [[nitrofurantoin]], which is classified as a [[Preg Cat B]] drug and is used with caution during pregnancy. 

The anti-infectives should be used cautiously in those with renal or hepatic impairment. Clients who are allergic to tartrazine (a food dye) should not take [[methenamine]] (Hiprex). This drug is used cautiously in clients with gout, because it may cause crystals to form in the urine. [[nitrofurantoin]] is used cautiously in clients with cerebral arteriosclerosis, diabetes, or a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
