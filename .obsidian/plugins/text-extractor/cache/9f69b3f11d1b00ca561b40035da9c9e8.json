consist of opioids and nonopioids Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) - patient is able to self- medicate by pressing a button on a PCA infusion pump Opioid tolerance - state of adaptation; exposure to a drug causes changes in drug receptors that result in decreased drug effects over time Analgesic ceiling effect - drug reaches a maximum analgesic effect; analgesia does not improve with higher dose Adjuvant drugs - assist the primary drugs in relieving pain; help decrease amount of opioids used and adverse effects; e.g. NSAIDS, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs; corticosteroids 3-step analgesic ladder - Step 1: use of nonopioids (with or w/o adjuvant meds) Step 2: use of opioids (with or w/o nonopioids or adjuvant meds) Step 3: use of opioids indicated for moderate to severe pain (with or w/o nonopioids or adjuvant meds) Agonists: bind to opioid pain receptor in the brain and causes an analgesic response Agonists-Antagonists (partial agonists): bind to opioid pain receptor and causes a weaker pain response Antagonists (nonanalgesics): binds to a pain receptor but does not cause analgesic response (competes with agonist or agonist-antagonist) Alleviate moderate to severe pain Combined with anesthetic during surgery Management of postoperative and procedural pain For long-term pain mngt (transdermal fentanyl) Cough suppression (codeine, hydrocodone) Diarrhea Reverse respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdosage (Naloxone) Severe asthma Caution: respiratory insufficiency; morbid obesity; sleep apnea; myasthenia gravis; paralytic ileus; pregnancy All have strong potential for abuse CNS depression (may lead to respiratory depression) Nausea; vomiting; constipation Hypotension; bradycardia Itching; rash; pruritus Urinary retention Alcohol Antihistamines Barbiturates Benzodiazepines Phenothiazine Other CNS depressants MAOIs Mechanism of Action: Indications: Contraindications: Adverse effects: Interactions: Opioid Analgesics alfentanil (Alfenta) codeine sulfate fentanyl (Duragesic, Oralet, Actiq) heroin hydrocodone (Hysingla, Vicodin [with acetaminophen]) hydromorphone (Dilaudid) meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) methadone hydrochloride (Dolophine) morphine sulfate (Kadian, MS Contin) oxycodone (Oxy IR, OxyContin, Percocet [with acetaminophen]) remifentanil (Ultiva) sufentanil (Dsuvia, Sufenta) buprenorphine (Buprenex) butorphanol (Stadol) nalbuphine (Nubain) pentazocine (Talwin) naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) Opioid Agonists: Opioid Agonists-Antagonists: Opioid Antagonists: Black Box Warning High potential for abuse and respiratory depression Risk of combined use with benzodiazepines: extreme sleepiness, respiratory depression, coma, death Analgesic Drugs Mild pain - use nonopioid drugs and nonpharm measures Moderate to severe pain - use opioids using stepped approach Check 9 rights and administer as ordered before pain gets out of control Monitor vitals with special attn to any respiratory changes; 10- 12 breaths/min must be reported to prescriber Naloxone must always be available Monitor UO, bowel sounds, pupillary reaction to light (pinpoint pupils indicate a possible overdose) Must know equianalgesia (able to compare meds and give comparable analgesia) Give oral dose with food Chewing or crushing of any extended-release opioid drug can cause oversedation, respiratory depression and even death May need antiemetic if N/V Keep bedside rails up and call bell within reach to prevent falls/injury related to opioid use Morphine - if decline in pt's condition or abnormal vitals- withhold drug and contact prescriber Patch - apply to clean, nonhairy area; use new site when changing; clean old site thoroughly before applying new patch; monitor for contact dermatitis; maintain pain journal at home Considerations / Patient Education IV dosing - monitor pain levels, response to meds, vitals, IV needle site, infusion rates PCA - keep track of amount/timing of doses; monitor equipment often Overdose - Naloxone via IV; diluted; administer slowly as ordered Opioid agonists-antagonists: if given at same time as other opioids leads to reversal of analgesia and acute withdrawal If pain present for >12 hours/day best to administer around the clock Each patient's pain needs are individualized Educate: Do not use alcohol or other CNS depressant Know ingredients of OTC meds For constipation: force fluids up to 3 L/day, fiber, exercise, may need stool softeners Encourage to share any history of addiction May need combo of meds to control pain Report: dizziness, difficulty breathing, BP, sedation, confusion, loss of memory, N/V Nonopioid Analgesics acetaminophen (Tylenol) NSAIDS Blocks peripheral pain impulses by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis Acts on hypothalamus (regulates body temperature) Treatment of mild to moderate pain and fever Substitute for aspirin Children and adolescents with flu Severe liver disease G6PD deficiency Mechanism of Action: Indications: Contraindications: Skin disorders;
