Precordial pain refers to pain located in the precordial region, which is the area on the anterior (front) surface of the chest over the [[Heart]]. This type of pain can arise from various conditions, both cardiac and non-cardiac, including:

- **Cardiac Causes**: Angina, myocardial infarction ([[Heart]] attack), pericarditis, and myocarditis.
- **Non-Cardiac Causes**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), musculoskeletal issues (such as costochondritis), [[anxiety]] or panic attacks, and pulmonary conditions like pleuritis.

Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment are important, especially if the pain is suspected to be of cardiac origin.
