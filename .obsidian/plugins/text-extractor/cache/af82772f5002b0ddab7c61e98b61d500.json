prevention of this process means that sodium and water are not retained and blood pressure decreases Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Actions ❖ Calcium channel blockers: inhibit the movement of calcium ions across the cell membranes of cardiac and arterial muscle cells; results in less calcium available for the transmission of nerve impulses and blood vessels relax; increases the supply of oxygen to the heart and reduces the heart’s workload ❖ Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: block the binding of angiotensin II at various receptor sites in the vascular smooth muscle and adrenal gland; blocks the vasoconstrictive effect of the renin-angiotensin system and release of aldosterone; results in lowering blood pressure Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Uses ❖ Used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure ❖ Different types of hypertensives are often prescribed to be taken together if the client’s hypertension does not respond to just one drug therapy ❖ Nitroprusside is used via IV to treat hypertensive emergencies Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Adverse Reactions #1 ❖ Central Nervous System Reactions: o Fatigue o Depression o Dizziness o Headache o Syncope Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Adverse Reactions #2 ❖ Respiratory System Reactions: o Upper respiratory infections o Cough Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Adverse Reactions #3 ❖ Gastrointestinal System Reactions: o Abdominal pain o Nausea o Diarrhea o Constipation o Gastric irritation o Anorexia Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Adverse Reactions #4 ❖ Other Reactions: o Rash o Pruritis o Dry mouth o Tachycardia o Hypotension o Proteinuria o Neutropenia o Orthostatic hypotension Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Contraindications ❖ Contraindications: o known hypersensitivity to the drugs o ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers: impaired renal function, salt or volume depletion, bilateral stenosis, angioedema, pregnancy (pregnancy category C), and lactation o Calcium channel blockers: sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree heart block, hypotension, ventricular dysfunction, and cardiogenic shock Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Precautions #1 ❖ Use cautiously in clients with: ❖ Renal or hepatic impairment ❖ Electrolyte imbalances ❖ Lactation and pregnancy Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Antihypertensive Drugs—Precautions #2 ❖ Calcium-channel blockers: heart failure, renal or hepatic impairment, pregnancy (pregnancy category C) and lactation ❖ ACEIs: sodium depletion, hypovolemia, coronary or cerebrovascular insufficiency, clients receiving diuretic therapy or dialysis ❖ Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: renal or hepatic dysfunction, hypovolemia, volume or salt depletion, and in clients receiving high doses of diuretics Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved ACEI Drug—Interactions #1 Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved ACEI Drug—Interactions #2 Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Calcium Channel Blockers—Interactions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists—Interactions Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Pharmacology in Practice Exercise #2 ❖ A client with diabetes mellitus and hypertension is on insulin and enalapril for hypertension.
