Discuss the importance of good pain assessment. 2. Compare and contrast standardized methods to assess pain in different client populations. 3. Explain the uses, general drug actions, common adverse reactions, contraindications, precautions, and interactions of the nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 4.

Distinguish important preadministration and ongoing assessment activities the nurse should perform on the client taking an NSAID. 6. List nursing diagnoses particular to a client taking an NSAID. 7. Examine the ways to promote an optimal response to therapy, how to manage common adverse reactions, and important points to keep in mind when educating clients about the use of NSAIDs. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Pain Assessment #1  A key component to good pain management is the pain assessment.  Pain is subjective.  The location and intensity of the pain should be assessed—pain can be localized or referred.  Pain is often referred to as the “5th vital sign.” Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer · All Rights Reserved Pain Assessment #2 Sample Assessment Questions o Does the pain keep you awake at night? Prevent you from falling asleep or staying asleep? o What makes your pain worse? What makes it better? o Can you describe what your pain feels like? Sharp, stabbing, burning, or throbbing. o Does the pain affect your mood? Are you depressed? Irritable? Anxious? o What over-the-counter medications or herbal remedies have you used for the pain? o Does the pain affect your activity level? Are you able to walk? Perform self-care activities?

The client has hypertension and diabetes. Current medications include lisinopril 20 mg every day, metformin ER 500 mg twice a day, and aspirin 81 mg every day. The client has tried acetaminophen in the past to treat joint pain, but with little relief. The physician diagnoses the client with osteoarthritis and writes a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. The physician has asked you, the nurse, to bring the prescription and provide client teaching. 1. What should the nurse tell the client about taking the ibuprofen with other medications? 2. How should the nurse advise the client to take the ibuprofen? 3. What side effect should the nurse discuss with the client about ibuprofen?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
