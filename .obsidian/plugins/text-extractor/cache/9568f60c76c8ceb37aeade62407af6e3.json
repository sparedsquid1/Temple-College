FACTORS AFFECTING SLEEP Difficulty getting rest Shiftwork-Evening/Night Sleep deprived Students studying at night Jet lag Travelers Caffeine Nicotine Alcohol Lifestyle Too hot or cold Too noisy Ambient light Environment Sleep Disorders Snoring Insomnia Sleep Apnea Narcolepsy SLEEP DISORDERS • Defined: difficulty in getting to sleep or staying asleep • Short-term or long-term • Transient (short-term) insomnia-Stress, excitement, change in sleeping arrangement • Chronic insomnia-medical, behavioral, psychiatric problem • Chronic insomnia requires treatment from healthcare provider Insomnia: • Condition where person stops/pauses breathing for brief periods during sleep • Obstructive, Central, Mixed Complex-mild, moderate, severe Sleep Apnea: • Sudden onset, recurrent, uncontrollable episodes of sleep during normal hours of wakefulness • Few seconds to more than 30 minutes • Symptoms usually begin at 25 years old • No cure-drug and behavioral therapies • Regular exercise and bright light exposure, stimulant medications • Sleep log or diaries Narcolepsy: (Williams, pg. 621) SLEEP APNEA • Most common • Caused by relaxation of soft tissues, bony structures obstructing airway • Has visible respiratory effort-but may not move air past the obstruction • Often do not remember waking • Obstructive Sleep Apnea Animation (ProPlayerSleep, 2013) Obstructive Apnea: • Less common • Caused by failure of brain to communicate with respiratory musces • Cessation of breathing with no observable respiratory effort • As oxygen saturation decreases-breathing is resumed • What is Central Sleep Apnea? (Whitneysleepcenter, 2013) Central Apnea: • Combination of obstructive and central Mixed Apnea: (Williams, pg. 621) SLEEP APNEA TREATMENTS • Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) • Small compressor to maintain airflow via mask or nasal prongs • Dental appliance to reposition the tongue or jaw • Surgical procedures to correct obstruction Obstructive Sleep Apnea • Does not respond to CPAP • Treated by specialist Central Apnea: Combination of obstructive and central Mixed Apnea: (Williams, pg. 621) TREATMENTS Small compressor use during sleep to maintain airflow via mask of nasal prongs Central apnea does not respond to CPAP CPAP Tips from FDA Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Placed to reposition the tongue or jaw deterring obstruction Dental Appliance Correcting obstruction Mount Sinai Spotlight: Inspire Therapy Surgery For Sleep Apnea Surgical procedures TREATMENTSSNORING . Causes: • Vibration and/or obstruction of air passages at the back of the mouth and nose • Poor muscle tone, excessive tissue, or deformities such as deviated septum • Colds and allergies • May be symptom of sleep apnea • Treatment for mild snoring- exercise to develop good muscle tone and lose weight if need • Treatment for moderate or severe-referral may be needed NARCOLEPSY • Sudden onset, recurrent, uncontrollable episodes of sleep during normal waking hours • Few seconds to more than 30 minutes • Symptoms usually begin by 25 years old • No cure-stimulant medications and behavioral therapy, regular exercise, exposure to sunlight • Sleep log and diaries • Cataplexy-Medical Condition which strong emotion or laughter causes a person to suddenly collapse Recognize Cues- History Illness or injury Sleep diary Assessment Analyze Cues & Prioritize Hypotheses- Problem Statements: Disrupted sleep pattern Insomnia Fatigue Acute pain Anxiety Altered breathing pattern Data Analysis/Nursing Diagnosis Generate Solutions- Set goals Pay attention to amount of sleep patient needs Planning Take Action-What can the Nurse do to help patient?
