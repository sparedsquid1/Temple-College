Meet Mr. Charles Greene (\"Mean\" Joe Green) • Mr. Greene is a 74 year-old male who prefers to be called \"Mean\" Joe Greene. He is a former professional defensive tackle football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers (1969 to 1981), two time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and All- Pro with 10 Pro Bowl appearances. Mr. Greene is from Temple Texas and his #75 jersey was retired on Oct. 1, 2021. Mr. Greene is attending a community wide event promoting cardiac health, in which you are the Keynote Speaker. Following your presentation, Mr. Greene approaches you with the following questions: Mr. Charles Greene (\"Mean\" Joe Green) \"My aunt has mitral valve prolapse, and every time she has dental surgery, she has to take antibiotics before the surgery. Why is this?\" What are you to say to Mean Joe? \"I read that cardiomyopathy can cause complications, but I am still unsure what they may be. Can you explain what can happen to those with this disease?\" What will you tell Mean Joe? \"When you were talking about pericardiocentesis, it reminded me of a game when we were playing the Patriots and the Running Back got hit and ended up having to have that procedure.\" What is the correlation between Mr. Greene's story and pericardiocentesis? What would have been the risk to the player if they had not performed it immediately? \"One more thing before I go. When I was playing for the Steelers, there was a player who came down with endocarditis. We all were worried about our buddy and couldn't figure out how he even knew he had it. What are some symptoms of this?\" What will you tell the Temple Icon? • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjaWKK6ylQgVenous Disorders Thrombophlebitis • Formation of blood clot and inflammation within the vein • Normally affects legs, thighs, pelvis-can be superficial or deep vein • Three factors involved in formation: • Stasis of blood flow • Damage to lining of vein wall • Increased blood coagulation • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N_b xIzFGOI Thi s Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC.

He is an American actor playing in numerous movies from his Dazed and Confused (1993) to The Wedding Planner, How to lose a guy in 10 days, Failure to Launch, to The Lincoln Lawyer and numerous more. • While visiting the Capital in Austin, you notice Mr. McConaughey sitting on a bench inside the Capital and decide to go over and meet him. • As you walk towards Mr. McConaughey, he smiles, and you introduce yourself. Small talk proceeds and he asks you what you do for a living. You share you are a nursing student at Temple College, and he responds with \"alright, alright, alright.\" Meet Mr. McConaughey • Then he says, \"Hey TC Leopard, can I ask you something?\" You say \"sure\" and he tells you his mother has recently been diagnosed with Thrombophlebitis in her left leg. He says he was worried about her because the doctor didn't make her stay in the hospital and be one some \"blood thinners.\" What do you tell Mr. McConaughey why the provider didn't hospitalize his mother? • You then ask Mr. McConaughey what symptoms his mother has. What symptoms are you expecting him to say? • He then says, \"well if you were her nurse, what would you tell her to do?\" What do you tell him? Meet Mr. McConaughey • He thanks you for your time, education, and reassurance for his mother. Then he asks if he could get a Temple College Leopard's t-shirt to wear on Saturdays instead of the team shirt, he \"usually wears.\" You come back to the college and share your experience with Dr. X and she asks if you gave him the TC shirt yet...to which you said, \"Not yet.\" Dr. X says, \"don't you worry about getting it to him....I would be more than happy to do that!\" • You respond by saying \"alright, alright, alright.\" • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzbVXCUh UOY","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
