A nurse has administered albuterol to a client with asthma, who is now reporting dizziness, especially when standing up. When analyzing the client's record for potential sources, which prescribed medications should the nurse question? A) Warfarin B) Theophylline C) Atenolol D) Methyldopa Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should consider methyldopa as a cause for the client's concern of dizziness on standing, suggesting orthostatic hypotension. Methyldopa and albuterol interact, leading to hypotension. Albuterol does not interact with warfarin. The use of theophylline will increase the risk of cardiotoxicity. The use of beta-adrenergic blockers will inhibit cardiac, bronchodilating, and vasodilating effects of the adrenergic medication.
