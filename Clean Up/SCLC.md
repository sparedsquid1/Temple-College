Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive form of lung cancer that accounts for about 10-15% of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] lung cancer cases. It is strongly associated with smoking and tends to grow and spread more quickly than non-small-cell lung cancer ([[nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer]]). Because of its rapid growth, SCLC often spreads to other parts of the body before it is detected, making it more challenging to treat.

### Characteristics of SCLC:
- **Rapid Growth**: SCLC tends to double in size quickly and can metastasize early in its course, often to the brain, [[Liver]], adrenal glands, and bones.
- **Central Location**: It usually starts in the [[bronchi]] near the center of the chest.
- **Neuroendocrine Features**: SCLC cells often share characteristics with nerve cells and hormone-producing cells, leading to the production of certain [[Hormones]] that can cause paraneoplastic syndromes.

### Risk Factors:
- **Smoking**: The most significant risk factor, with over 95% of cases linked to smoking.
- **Secondhand Smoke**: Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases the risk.
- **Occupational Exposures**: Exposure to substances like asbestos, radon, and other carcinogens.
- **Genetic Factors**: While less common, family history and genetic predispositions can contribute.

### Symptoms:
- **Persistent Cough**: Often the first symptom, which may worsen over time.
- **Coughing up [[Blood]] (Hemoptysis)**: Indicates bleeding in the lungs.
- **Shortness of Breath**: Due to tumor obstruction in the airways.
- **Chest Pain**: Especially if the cancer involves the chest wall or pleura.
- **Hoarseness**: If the cancer affects the nerves that control the voice box.
- **Unexplained Weight Loss** and **Fatigue**.
- **Symptoms of Metastasis**: Such as headaches, bone pain, or jaundice, depending on where the cancer has spread.

### Diagnosis:
- **Imaging Tests**: Chest X-rays, CT scans, and PET scans to detect tumors and assess spread.
- **Biopsy**: A tissue sample is necessary for a definitive diagnosis, usually obtained through bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or surgery.
- **[[Blood]] Tests**: Can detect paraneoplastic syndromes or tumor markers, though not specific for SCLC.

### Staging:
SCLC is often classified into two stages:
1. **Limited Stage**: Cancer is confined to one side of the chest and can be treated with a single radiation field. About one-third of patients present with limited-stage disease.
2. **Extensive Stage**: Cancer has spread beyond one side of the chest, including to distant organs. This is the more common presentation, occurring in about two-thirds of patients.

### Treatment:
Treatment for SCLC depends on the stage and overall health of the patient:
- **Chemotherapy**: The mainstay of treatment for both limited and extensive-stage SCLC. Chemotherapy is often combined with other treatments.
- **Radiation Therapy**: Used in limited-stage SCLC, typically in combination with chemotherapy. It may also be used to treat or prevent metastasis to the brain (prophylactic cranial irradiation).
- **Immunotherapy**: Recently approved for use in extensive-stage SCLC in combination with chemotherapy, targeting the immune system to better fight cancer.
- **Surgery**: Rarely used because SCLC is usually widespread at diagnosis. However, it may be considered in very early-stage disease followed by chemotherapy.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for SCLC is generally poor due to its aggressive [[nature]] and tendency to be diagnosed at an advanced stage. The 5-year survival rate for limited-stage SCLC can range from 20% to 30% with aggressive treatment, while for extensive-stage SCLC, the survival rate drops significantly to around 2% to 10%. Early detection and advances in treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy, can improve survival and quality of life for some patients.
