## 📘 Summary of Chapter 29: The Child with a Genitourinary Condition

### 🔹 Development and Function of the GU System
The genitourinary (GU) system includes:
- Two kidneys
- Two ureters
- A urinary bladder
- A urethra

Its main roles are to eliminate waste products from the body and help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance (homeostasis).

---

### 🔹 Assessment of Urinary Function
Diagnostic tools include:
- **Urinalysis (UA)** and **urine cultures** (for infection)
- Imaging: **IVP**, **CT scan**, and **VCUG scan**
- Lab tests to assess renal function

---

### 🔹 Common Terminology
- **Dysuria** – Painful urination
- **Polyuria** – Excessive urination
- **Oliguria** – Decreased urine output
- **Nocturia** – Frequent nighttime urination
- **Enuresis** – Involuntary urination (usually at night)
- **Frequency/Urgency** – Needing to urinate often and quickly

---

### 🔹 Phimosis
- Narrowing of the foreskin opening
- Common in infants and toddlers; usually resolves by age 3
- May require circumcision if persistent or symptomatic

---

### 🔹 Hypospadias and Epispadias
- **Hypospadias**: Urethral opening on the underside of the penis; may be accompanied by **chordee** (curvature)
- **Epispadias**: Urethral opening on the upper surface of the penis
- **Surgery** is done around 6–12 months of age; **circumcision is avoided** before surgery
- Post-op care includes infection prevention, catheter care, and avoiding pressure on the site

---

### 🔹 Exstrophy of the Bladder
- A severe defect where the bladder and abdominal wall are open
- Requires immediate protection (plastic covering) and surgical repair
- Focus on preventing infection and preserving tissue integrity

---

### 🔹 Obstructive Uropathy
- Blockage in the urinary tract leading to backflow of urine
- Surgical interventions: **ureterostomy, nephrostomy, vesicostomy**, etc.
- Emotional support is key due to the psychological impact, especially at developmental milestones

---

### 🔹 Acute Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
**Infants**:
- Diaper rash, poor feeding, foul-smelling urine, fever, and weight loss
**Older children**:
- Urinary frequency, pain, abdominal pain, bedwetting, hematuria
**Treatment**: Antibiotics (penicillin, Bactrim) and addressing any anatomical defects

---

### 🔹 Nephrotic Syndrome
- A glomerular disease with:
    - Edema, proteinuria (foamy urine), irritability, weight gain
- **Treatment**: Steroids, immunosuppressants, diuretics, infection prevention
- Monitor weight, abdominal girth, I&O, and provide nutritional support

---

### 🔹 Acute Glomerulonephritis (AGN)
- Often follows **strep throat** (post-streptococcal)
- Symptoms: Hematuria (brown urine), periorbital edema, hypertension
- **Treatment**: Penicillin, rest, strict fluid monitoring, blood pressure control

---

### 🔹 Wilm’s Tumor (Nephroblastoma)
- Malignant renal tumor; presents with abdominal swelling
- Treated with **surgery**, radiation, and chemo
- **Do NOT palpate the abdomen** due to risk of tumor rupture

---

### 🔹 Hydrocele
- Fluid accumulation in the scrotum; usually resolves by age 1
- Chronic hydrocele may require surgery

---

### 🔹 Cryptorchidism
- Undescended testes
- Risk of sterility or torsion
- Treated with **orchiopexy**; monitor for infection and educate family

---

### 🔹 Testicular Torsion
- Medical emergency; symptoms include sudden scrotal pain, swelling, and nausea
- Requires **immediate surgical intervention**

---

### **4.** A child with AGN has dark-colored urine. This is due to:

**A.** Proteinuria  
**B.** Hematuria  
**C.** Bacteria  
**D.** Bilirubin

✅ **Correct: B** – AGN often causes hematuria, resulting in tea- or cola-colored urine.

---

### **5.** What is the first action when a nurse notes a firm abdominal mass in a child with Wilm’s tumor?

**A.** Document size  
**B.** Palpate mass  
**C.** Notify provider  
**D.** Apply warm compress

✅ **Correct: C** – The mass should not be palpated; notify the provider immediately.

---

### **6.** Which condition most requires immediate surgery?

**A.** Hydrocele  
**B.** Cryptorchidism  
**C.** Testicular torsion  
**D.** Phimosis

✅ **Correct: C** – Torsion cuts off blood supply and is a surgical emergency.

---

### **7.** The most appropriate diagnostic test for a suspected UTI is:

**A.** Renal biopsy
