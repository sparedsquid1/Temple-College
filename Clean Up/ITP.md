Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]). Platelets are [[Blood]] cells that help with clotting, and a low platelet count can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding.

### Types of ITP:
- **Acute ITP:** Most commonly occurs in children, often following a viral infection, and usually resolves on its own within a few weeks to months.
- **Chronic ITP:** More common in adults and is a longer-lasting condition that can persist for more than six months or even years.

### Causes:
- **Autoimmune reaction:** The immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, reducing their number in the bloodstream.
- **Viral infections:** ITP often follows a viral infection, particularly in children.
- **Medications:** Certain medications can trigger ITP by affecting the immune system.
- **Associated conditions:** ITP can be associated with other autoimmune disorders like lupus or can occur after certain vaccinations.

### Symptoms:
- **Purpura:** Reddish or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin.
- **Petechiae:** Tiny red or purple dots on the skin, often seen on the lower legs.
- **Easy or excessive bruising:** Due to low platelet levels, even minor trauma can cause bruises.
- **Prolonged bleeding:** Cuts or injuries may take longer to stop bleeding.
- **Nosebleeds or bleeding gums:** These are common signs of low platelet count.
- **Heavy menstrual periods:** Women with ITP may experience heavier menstrual bleeding.
- **Fatigue:** Some people with ITP may feel tired or fatigued, although this is less common.

### Diagnosis:
- **Complete [[Blood]] count (CBC):** This [[Blood]] test will show a low platelet count, often the first indication of ITP.
- **Bone marrow biopsy:** Rarely needed but may be performed to rule out other conditions if the diagnosis is uncertain.
- **[[Blood]] smear:** Examining a [[Blood]] sample under a microscope can help identify abnormalities in [[Blood]] cells.

### Treatment:
Treatment of ITP depends on the severity of the condition and whether the patient is experiencing symptoms.

- **Observation:** Mild cases of ITP, especially in children, may not require treatment and can be monitored over time.
- **[[Corticosteroids]]:** Medications like [[prednisone]] are often used to suppress the immune system and increase platelet count.
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG):** This treatment temporarily increases platelet counts by altering the immune system's response.
- **Anti-D immunoglobulin:** Used in Rh-positive patients, particularly in those who are non-severely anemic.
- **Splenectomy:** Surgical removal of the spleen may be considered in chronic ITP cases that do not respond to other treatments, as the spleen is where platelets are often destroyed.
- **Thrombopoietin receptor agonists:** Medications like [[romiplostim]] or [[eltrombopag]] can stimulate the bone marrow to produce more platelets.
- **Immunosuppressive [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]:** Other medications that suppress the immune system may be used in chronic cases.

### Complications:
- **Severe bleeding:** Although rare, severe internal bleeding, particularly in the brain (intracranial hemorrhage), can occur and is a medical emergency.
- **Side effects of treatment:** Long-term use of [[Corticosteroids]] can lead to complications like bone loss, weight gain, and increased infection risk.

### Prognosis:
- **Children:** Most children with ITP recover completely within six months, often without the need for treatment.
- **Adults:** Chronic ITP can be more challenging to manage, but many patients respond well to treatment and can maintain a good quality of life. However, some may experience persistent low platelet counts and require ongoing therapy.
