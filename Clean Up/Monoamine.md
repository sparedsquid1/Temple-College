Monoamines are a type of neurotransmitter that contain one amino group connected to an aromatic ring by a two-carbon chain (-CH₂-CH₂-). They play crucial roles in regulating mood, arousal, and cognition. The primary monoamines in the human brain are:

1. **[[Dopamine]]**: Involved in reward, motivation, and motor control.
2. **Serotonin**: Regulates mood, appetite, and sleep.
3. **Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)**: Affects attention and responding actions in the brain, as well as [[Heart]] rate and [[Blood]] pressure in the body.
4. **[[Epinephrine]] (adrenaline)**: Primarily involved in the body's fight-or-flight response.

These neurotransmitters are derived from amino acids and are implicated in various psychiatric and neurological disorders.
