Pseudomembranous colitis is an inflammation of the colon caused by an overgrowth of the bacterium *Clostridium difficile* (C. difficile). This condition often occurs after the use of antibiotics, which disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the gut and allow C. difficile to proliferate. 

Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis include severe diarrhea (often with mucus or [[Blood]]), abdominal cramping, [[Fever]], and nausea. In more severe cases, it can lead to complications such as dehydration, colonic perforation, or sepsis.

Diagnosis is typically based on stool tests for C. difficile toxins, and treatment generally involves specific antibiotics that target C. difficile, such as [[vancomycin]] or [[fidaxomicin]]. In some cases, probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation may also be used to help restore the normal balance of gut bacteria.
