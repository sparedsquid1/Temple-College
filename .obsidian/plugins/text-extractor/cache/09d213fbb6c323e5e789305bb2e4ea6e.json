Objectives Describe The significance of normal and abnormal vital signs Demonstrate Measuring and recording vital signs Vital Signs & Physical Assessment Checklist & Check-off • You must pass the Vital Sign (V/S) and Physical Assessment (PA) Skill to pass course • 3 attempts to be successful • Vital Signs and Physical Assessment will be a combined attempt • 35 minutes total • 15 minutes for Vital Signs • 20 minutes for Physical Assessment • Starred (*) items must be performed correctly or will be a failure • Two unstarred (*) items will indicate a failure • If pass one skill (V/S or PA) and fail the other • You will be required to only retest on failed skill • Remediation in Simulation Lab is required for failed skills • Open Lab is encouraged! • Schedule with Simulation Lab Faculty Practice is the key to success! \"Do not practice until you get it right... practice until you can't possibly get it wrong\" How to Learn a New Skill • Break the skill into understandable parts Deconstruct the skill • Practice and recognize when you are making mistakes and being successful Learn enough to self-correct • Dedicate to practice no matter what happens Remove practice barriers • This is important! • Skill Practice Log Practice 20 hours • Distractions • Self-doubt Ban Skill Practice Log • Bring to class • Add hours • In class • Out of class • Simulation Lab Open Lab • Monitoring progress • Dedicate to reach goal Vital Signs-Indication of a Person's State of Health Temperature Pulse Respirations Blood pressure Oxygen saturation Pain Prior to Taking Vital Signs Always wash your hands! • Always always always wash your hands IMMEDIATEY when entering a patient room and BEFORE touching a patient! • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IisgnbMfKvI Steps Taken Before Beginning Vital Signs 1Gather equipment 2 * WASH HANDS! •Wear gloves when appropriate 3Clean stethoscope and equipment 4 Identify self to client as student nurse 5 Identify client using TWO verifiers •\"Can you tell me you name and date of birth?\" •Match armband to what they are saying 6 Explain you will be assessing v/s and physical assessment •\"I will now assess your vital signs and conduct a physical assessment\" Provide privacy Temperature Measuring Body Temperature • Normal body temperature ranges: • 97.5 F to 99.5 F (36.4 C-37.5 C) • Average of healthy young adult: • 98.6 F (37.0 C) • Individual patient ranges: • Know what is normal to compare • Temperature most accurate when measured at site with rick blood supply • Fever: usually not considered a fever until over 100.2 F (37.9 C) • Elevation may be from reaction to surgery, injury, not illness This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC. Factors Influencing Temperature Readings • Measurement sites • Mouth (oral) • Rectum (rectal) • 1 degree higher than oral • Axilla (armpit) • 1 degree lower than oral • Ear (tympanic) • Same as oral • Skin (temporal artery) • Most accurate • 1 degree higher than oral Let's try it • Oral temperature is 99.0 F • What would the rectal temperature be? • What would the axillary temperature be? • What would the temporal temperature be? • Which is the most accurately reflection of the core temperature? Why? TEMPERATURE SKILL-FOR CHECK-OFF Measuring Oral Temperature- Electronic Thermometer Anything oral last 15 minutes... • Wait 15-30 minutes *Place disposable probe cover on thermometer probe *Place oral temperature probe in sublingual pocket Unit beeps • Remove probe & discard State temperature • State \" Temperature is 98.6\" *Wash hands or continue with vital signs • Disinfection or soap and water PulseMeasuring the Pulse Each time heart contracts arterial walls expand to accept increase pressure Pressure wave is called the pulse Counting each pulsation of arterial wall...determine the pulse rate Pulse Rate- Adult • 60-100 beats per minute (bpm) Normal • Greater than 100 bpm • Report to Charge Nurse or Provider Tachycardia-Fast • Less than 60 bpm • Report to Charge Nurse or Provider Bradycardia-Slow Radial Artery Most often chosen palpate (feel) Best found by Placing flat part of first two fingers against tendon, on thumb side on inner wrist Then rolling fingers slightly outwards into little trough on the thumb side of wrist Pulse Characteristics Rate • Normal • Tachycardic • Bradycardic Strength • Strong/weak Regularity • Regular/irregular Other than normal • Report to Charge Nurse or Provider Taking Radial Pulse • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmfAB HbL-HM RADIAL PULSE SKILL- FOR CHECK-OFF Radial Artery Steps • radial artery*Locate • For 30 seconds and multiply by 2 *Use fingertips to count pulse • Strength • Strong/Weak • Regularity • Regular, irregular Assess • \"Pulse is strong and regular\"State Respirations Measuring Respirations • Change in rate may indicate change in condition • Always considered along with other vital signs and assessment • Respirations are influenced by • Emotions • Pain • Age • Fever • Disease conditions • Drugs • Narcotic analgesics and sedatives can reduce respirations • Monitor before and after administering Normal Ranges of Respirations Older adult • 16-20 per minute Healthy adult • 12-20 per minute Adolescent • 16-20 per minute Child • 20-30 per minute Infant up to 1 year • 20-40 per minute Newborn • 30-80 per minute • Following radial pulse reading... • Count respirations while continuing to hold the client's radial pulse as if you were still counting the pulse • Count the respirations for 30 seconds and multiple X2 • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BL4CBUTe UU RESPIRATION SKILL- FOR CHECK-OFF This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC. Respiration Steps Assess Assess depth, pattern, effort, sounds •Depth: Shallow, regular, deep •Pattern: Normal, tachypnea •Effort: Nonlabored or labored •State \"Respirations are regular, normal, and unlabored\" Count *Count for 30 seconds X 2 equals rate of 1 minute •If irregular or very ill-count for 1 full minute Position Position your watch •See dial and rise & fall of chest Distract Distract patient while counting •As if you were still counting pulse Oxygen Saturation Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)- Pulse Oximetry • Machine that measures oxygen in blood • May be spot-checked or continuous • Measures percentage of hemoglobin in blood=oxygen saturation in blood • Sensor or probe • Normal SpO2 • Greater than 90% Pulse Oximetry • Normal SpO2 • Greater than 90% • Locations of use • Fingers • Toe • Forehead • Earlobe • Infant's foot • Site • Free of moisture • Good local circulation • No nail polish OXYGEN SATURATION SKILL-FOR CHECK-OFF This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY. Oxygen Saturation Steps Turn on power 1 Select site • Unpolished finger • Apply sensor flush to skin and secure 2 Determine reading 3Troubleshooting Pulse Oximetry Readings • If reading is lower than normal (less than 90%): • Ensure the reading is correct first! • Check fingers for nail polish or poor circulation (capillary refill test) • Warm the client's fingers • Obtain reading in second location (ear lobe) Blood Pressure Blood Pressure Pressure exerted on ARTERIAL walls by blood Pressures are dependent on whether the heart is contracting or resting What Are Systolic and Diastolic Pressures? Systolic pressure Maximum pressure exerted on artery during left ventricular contraction Diastolic pressure Lower pressure exerted on artery when heart is resting (between contractions) Measuring Blood Pressure- Types of Manometers • Sphygmomanometer & Stethoscope • Mercury gauge • Most accurate • Biohazard • Aneroid gauge • Less accurate • Smaller and easier to use • Must be recalibrated every 6-12 months • Electronic gauge • Expensive • Unable to listen for irregular pulse Blood Cuff Sizes • Must be correct size for accurate reading • Incorrect size can alter reading up to 25 mm Hg • Proper width is 21% larger than diameter of arm • Use markings on cuff for proper placement and size • \"How to Put on an Adcuff Blood Pressure Cuff\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuN_Wl2Aqk What is a Normal Blood Pressure Range? • For healthy adult • Under 120/80 Blood Pressure Monitor Gauge • Lines • Large-20 mm Hg • Medium-10 mm Hg • Smaller-2 mm Hg • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXvh OQ0hYc Large Medium Small Korotkoff Sounds-Russian Surgeon, Identified Blood Pressure Sounds Phase I-Systolic Pressure • Tapping sound • Auscultatory gap (no sound) 1 Phase II • Swishing sound 2 Phase III • Knocking sound • Occurs with every heartbeat 3 Phase IV • Muffling sound 4 Phase V-Diastolic Pressure • The lasts sound before silence of sound 5 Let's Try It! • Korotkoff Blood Pressure Sights and Sounds SD • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= UfCr_wUepxo This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY. Guidelines for Measuring Blood Pressure Patient sit chair Feet flat on floor Rest before reading Use Brachial Artery Support arm Bare arm Equipment Used Place stethoscope flat Deflate cuff 2 mm/Hg per second Continue to listen Until cuff is deflated Auscultatory gap VS. Last Korotkoff sound Contraindications -Arm Blood Pressure Reading • Mastectomy • Serious injury • Lymph node dissection • Intravenous line • Dialysis shunt • If both arms are contraindicated: • Use thigh cuff on a legBLOOD PRESSURE SKILL-FOR CHECK-OFF This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-NC. Blood Pressure Steps Locate Brachial Artery Assess for contraindications • State \"Do you have any contraindications to taking your blood pressure in either of your arms? For example, have you had a mastectomy, removal of lymph nodes, or dialysis shunt?\" Assess size of arm to determine cuff size Wrap deflated BP cuff snugly around upper arm Palpate radial artery with fingertips Rapidly inflate cuff until you no longer feel radial pulse. Note palpated estimated systolic pressure Release valve and verbalize will wait 30 seconds *Place stethoscope over brachial artery with diaphragm flat against skin Inflate cuff 30 m Hg above palpated estimated systolic pressure Deflate cuff slowly * Listen for Korotkoff sounds and note blood pressure Release the valve completely Remove blood pressure cuff State \"The blood pressure is...\"","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
