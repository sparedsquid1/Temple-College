Myra's daughter asks what is the major cause of HF. What do you tell her? Plan Teaching for Patients with Heart Failure and Their Families- Fluid Balance • Fluid balance • Monitor for edema, weight gain, jugular vein distention, crackles, cough • Encourage to take diuretics- take during early hours (before 1600) • Have obstacle-free bathroom to avoid falls • Weigh daily-report weight gain of 2 –3 pounds over 1-2 days • Reduce high sodium foods What types of foods should you tell Myra to avoid? Plan Teaching for Patients with Heart Failure and Their Families- Coping • HF can be frustrating for patient and family • Assess coping skills and plan accordingly • Referrals to • Social workers • Marriage & Sex counselors • Family counselors Myra shares she is frustrated with her diagnosis and limited ability to do \"what she did before her HR.\" What types of resources or referrals could you provide for her? Plan Teaching for Patients with Heart Failure and Their Families-Diet • Diet-low sodium • Teach to read food label • Salt substitute may be high in potassium • Food preparers-do not add salt during cooking • Weight reduction-diet counseling • Anorexia • Several small meals to reduce heart's workload What should you teach Myra about her diet and her HF? Plan Teaching for Patients with Heart Failure and Their Families-Digitalis E D U C A T I O N W I T H D I G I T A L I S • Always take apical pulse before giving; less than 60 bpm hold and notify HCP • Hypokalemia increases heart's sensitivity to digitalis • Can lead to toxicity of digitalis • Teah with diuretic potassium may be decreased S I G N S A N D D I G I T A L I S T O X I C I T Y • Visual problems • Anorexia • Nausea • Bradycardia • Arrhythmia • Confusion 2 / 2 0 / 2 0 2 2 33 Myra is prescribed Digitalis.
