### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions to [[acetaminophen]] are rare when the drug is used as directed. Adverse reactions associated with [[acetaminophen]] usually occur with chronic use or when the recommended dosage is exceeded. They include the following: 
- Skin eruptions, [[urticaria]] (hives) 
- Hemolytic anemia 
- [[pancytopenia]] (a reduction in [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] cellular components of the [[Blood]]) 
- Hypoglycemia 
- Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin), [[Hepatotoxicity]] (damage to the [[Liver]]), and hepatic failure 

Acute [[acetaminophen]] poisoning or toxicity can occur after a single 10- to 15-g dose of [[acetaminophen]]. Doses of 20–25 g may be fatal. With excessive doses, the [[Liver]] cells undergo necrosis (die), and death can result from [[Liver]] failure. The risk of [[Liver]] failure increases in clients who drink [[Alcohol]] habitually. Signs of acute [[acetaminophen]] toxicity include nausea, vomiting, confusion, [[Liver]] tenderness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, jaundice, and acute hepatic and renal failure.
### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to [[acetaminophen]] is a contraindication to its use. [[Hepatotoxicity]] has occurred in habitual [[Alcohol]] users after therapeutic dosages. The individual taking [[acetaminophen]] should avoid [[Alcohol]] if taking more than an occasional dose of [[acetaminophen]] and avoid taking [[acetaminophen]] concurrently with the [[Salicylates]] or the [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]]. [[acetaminophen]] is classified as a [[Preg Cat B]] drug and is used cautiously during pregnancy and lactation. If an analgesic is necessary, it appears safe for short-term use. The drug is used cautiously in clients with severe or recurrent pain or high or continued [[Fever]] because this may indicate a serious untreated illness. If pain persists for more than 5 days or if redness or swelling is present, the primary health care provider should be consulted.
