**Neurofibromatosis (NF)** is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. These tumors can develop anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, [[Spinal cord]], and nerves. Neurofibromatosis is categorized into three main types, each with distinct genetic causes and clinical features: **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2),** and **Schwannomatosis.**

### 1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):
- **Prevalence:** NF1 is the most common type, affecting about 1 in 3,000 people.
- **Genetics:** It is caused by mutations in the **NF1 [[gene]]** located on [[chromosome]] 17. This [[gene]] encodes neurofibromin, a protein that helps regulate cell growth. Mutations lead to uncontrolled cell growth, resulting in tumors.
- **Clinical Features:**
  - **Caf√©-au-lait spots:** Light brown skin patches that are often present from birth.
  - **Neurofibromas:** Benign tumors that grow on nerves throughout the body. They can appear as lumps under the skin or deeper in the body.
  - **Lisch nodules:** Tiny, pigmented bumps on the iris of the eye, typically benign and not affecting [[Vision]].
  - **Freckling:** Particularly in the armpits or groin area.
  - **Learning disabilities:** Occur in up to 50% of individuals with NF1.
  - **Bone deformities:** Such as scoliosis or tibial dysplasia.
  - **Optic gliomas:** Tumors that develop on the optic nerve, potentially affecting [[Vision]].

### 2. Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2):
- **Prevalence:** NF2 is less common, affecting about 1 in 25,000 people.
- **Genetics:** Caused by mutations in the **NF2 [[gene]]** on [[chromosome]] 22. This [[gene]] encodes a protein called merlin or schwannomin, which acts as a tumor suppressor.
- **Clinical Features:**
  - **Vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas):** Benign tumors that develop on the nerves responsible for [[Hearing and Balance]], leading to hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems.
  - **Meningiomas:** Tumors that form in the membranes surrounding the brain and [[Spinal cord]].
  - **Spinal tumors:** Including ependymomas and other [[Spinal cord]]-related tumors.
  - **Cataracts:** Clouding of the lens of the eye, which can develop at an unusually young age.
  - **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, weakness, or pain in the limbs due to nerve damage.

### 3. Schwannomatosis:
- **Prevalence:** Schwannomatosis is the rarest form of neurofibromatosis.
- **Genetics:** It is associated with mutations in the **SMARCB1** or **LZTR1** genes. Unlike NF2, schwannomatosis does not typically involve vestibular schwannomas.
- **Clinical Features:**
  - **Schwannomas:** Multiple benign tumors that develop on peripheral nerves, leading to chronic pain, numbness, or weakness.
  - **Pain:** Severe and often chronic, related to the location of schwannomas.
  - **Neurological symptoms:** Depending on the location of the tumors, symptoms can include muscle weakness, sensory loss, or motor impairment.

### Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, [[genetic testing]], and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans. The presence of specific symptoms or the [[identification]] of mutations in the NF1, NF2, SMARCB1, or LZTR1 genes can confirm the diagnosis.

### Treatment:
- **Symptomatic Management:** There is no cure for neurofibromatosis, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications. This may include surgery to remove tumors, pain management, physical therapy, and monitoring for complications.
- **Targeted Therapy:** In recent years, targeted therapies such as **MEK inhibitors** (e.g., [[selumetinib]]) have shown promise in shrinking plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 patients.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers, including neurologists, ophthalmologists, and orthopedic specialists, are essential for managing the condition.

### Prognosis:
- The prognosis for individuals with neurofibromatosis varies widely depending on the type and severity of the disease. NF1 often leads to a normal life span, though complications can affect quality of life. NF2 and schwannomatosis may involve more significant neurological complications, potentially leading to disability.

### Support and Resources:
- Many patients and families benefit from genetic counseling and connecting with support groups, such as the **Children's Tumor Foundation** or the **Neurofibromatosis Network**, which provide resources and advocacy for those affected by neurofibromatosis.
