Cleaning the Injection Site 
??
- Open [[Alcohol]] swab
- Cleanse selected site gently
	- Use circular motion until area approximately 2 inches in diameter is clean
- Allow skin to dry
	- Vigorous rubbing increases [[Blood]] [[flow]] and increases the rapidity of absorption

Pulling Medication-Vial 
- Small bottle with rubber stopper 
- Attached by metal band 
- Volume 1 to 50 ml 
- May contain single use or multi-use medication 
- **Always inject an amount of AIR into the vial equal to medication to be withdrawn** 
- May be in powder form 
	- Requires reconstitution 
- Before mixing 2 medications in syringe 
	- **ALWAYS CHECK FOR COMPATIBILITY**

Route-Intradermal 
??
- Med is deposited into the dermal layer 
- Used for TB skin and allergy testing, plastic surgery 
- Forms a skin bleb or small bump 
- Do NOT aspirate or massage area 
- Produces small wheal (raised area) 
	- If wheal does not appear...good possibility drug entered subcutaneous tissue and test result is considered inaccurate
