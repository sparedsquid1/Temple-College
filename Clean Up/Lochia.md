Lochia is the vaginal discharge that occurs after childbirth as the [[uterus]] sheds its lining. It typically lasts for several weeks and goes through different stages, characterized by changes in color, consistency, and volume. 

### Stages of Lochia:

1. **Lochia Rubra (First 3-4 days):**
   - **Color:** Bright red.
   - **Consistency:** Similar to a heavy menstrual period, contains [[Blood]], small clots, and tissue.
   - **Volume:** The heaviest [[flow]] occurs in this stage.

2. **Lochia [[Serosa]] (4-10 days postpartum):**
   - **Color:** Pinkish or brownish.
   - **Consistency:** Thinner than lochia rubra, contains [[Blood]], mucus, and white [[Blood]] cells.
   - **Volume:** The [[flow]] decreases compared to the first stage.

3. **Lochia Alba (Up to 6 weeks postpartum):**
   - **Color:** Yellowish-white.
   - **Consistency:** Contains mostly mucus and leukocytes, with little to no [[Blood]].
   - **Volume:** The [[flow]] is minimal and gradually tapers off.

### When to Seek Medical Attention:

- If lochia has a foul odor (which may indicate infection).
- If there is a sudden return to bright red bleeding after it has decreased or stopped.
- If you pass large [[Blood]] clots (larger than a golf ball).
- If you experience symptoms like [[Fever]], chills, or severe abdominal pain.

Lochia is a normal part of the postpartum recovery process, but if there are any concerns, itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare provider.
