Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, which is an overactivity of the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease, the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading it to produce excessive amounts of thyroid [[Hormones]]. These [[Hormones]] regulate many aspects of metabolism, and their overproduction can lead to a variety of symptoms.

Common symptoms of Graves' disease include:
- **Weight loss** despite normal or increased appetite
- **Rapid or irregular heartbeat** (palpitations)
- **Nervousness or irritability**
- **Increased sweating**
- **Tremors in the hands or fingers**
- **Heat intolerance**
- **Goiter** (an enlarged thyroid gland)
- **Exophthalmos** (bulging eyes), which is particularly associated with Graves' disease

The exact cause of Graves' disease is not fully understood, but it involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment options typically include antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine therapy, and sometimes surgery to remove part or [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] of the thyroid gland.
