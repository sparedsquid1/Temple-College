Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refers to a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional [[Blood]] cells, originating from abnormalities in the bone marrow. MDS is considered a type of cancer and is often associated with a risk of progressing to acute myeloid [[Leukemia]] ([[acute myelocytic leukemia]]).

### Causes and Risk Factors:
- **Genetic Mutations**: Most cases of MDS arise from acquired mutations in the DNA of hematopoietic ([[Blood]]-forming) cells.
- **Previous Cancer Treatment**: Chemotherapy or radiation therapy can damage bone marrow, leading to MDS. This is known as therapy-related MDS.
- **Environmental Exposures**: Exposure to chemicals like benzene or heavy metals may increase the risk.
- **Age**: MDS is more common in older adults, typically over the age of 60.
- **Inherited Disorders**: Certain genetic conditions, like Fanconi anemia, can predispose individuals to MDS.

### Symptoms:
Symptoms of MDS are primarily related to the lack of healthy [[Blood]] cells and may include:
- **Anemia**: Causing fatigue, weakness, and pallor.
- **[[neutropenia]]**: A low white [[Blood]] cell count, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.
- **[[thrombocytopenia]]**: A low platelet count, resulting in easy bruising, bleeding gums, and frequent nosebleeds.
- **Shortness of Breath**: Often due to anemia.
- **Petechiae**: Small red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding.

### Diagnosis:
- **Complete [[Blood]] Count (CBC)**: Typically reveals low counts of one or more types of [[Blood]] cells (red cells, white cells, or platelets).
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: The definitive test for diagnosing MDS, showing abnormal cells and cellularity in the bone marrow.
- **Cytogenetic Analysis**: Identifies specific chromosomal abnormalities that can help classify MDS and [[Guide]] treatment.

### Classification:
MDS is classified based on the number and type of [[Blood]] cells affected, the presence of certain genetic abnormalities, and the percentage of immature cells (blasts) in the bone marrow. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is commonly used and includes subtypes like:
- **MDS with Single Lineage Dysplasia**
- **MDS with Multilineage Dysplasia**
- **MDS with Ring Sideroblasts**
- **MDS with Excess Blasts**
- **MDS Associated with Isolated del(5q)** (a specific chromosomal abnormality)

### Treatment:
Treatment depends on the type of MDS, the patient's symptoms, overall health, and risk of progression to [[acute myelocytic leukemia]]:
- **Supportive Care**: Includes [[Blood]] transfusions, growth factors (like erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), and antibiotics to manage symptoms and complications.
- **Drug Therapy**: 
  - **Hypomethylating Agents** (e.g., [[azacitidine]], [[decitabine]]) help control the disease by altering the DNA in the abnormal cells.
  - **Immunomodulatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]** (e.g., [[lenalidomide]]) are particularly effective in MDS with isolated del(5q).
  - **Chemotherapy**: Used in higher-risk MDS to reduce the number of abnormal cells.
- **Bone Marrow or Stem Cell Transplantation**: The only potential cure for MDS, usually recommended for younger patients or those with higher-risk disease. It involves replacing the damaged bone marrow with healthy cells from a donor.
- **Clinical Trials**: Patients may be eligible for trials testing new [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] or treatment approaches.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for MDS varies widely depending on the subtype, patient age, overall health, and specific genetic abnormalities. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and its revised version (IPSS-R) are commonly used to assess risk and [[Guide]] treatment decisions. For lower-risk MDS, patients may live many years with relatively stable disease, while higher-risk MDS is more likely to progress to [[acute myelocytic leukemia]] and has a poorer prognosis. 

Regular monitoring and tailored treatment plans are essential for managing MDS and improving quality of life.
