Grading: A minimum grade of 75% and successful completion of all skills checkoffs is required to pass the course. The grading system used by the Temple College VN program is listed below. There will be no rounding of grades. Refer also to the Promotion Policy in the VN Student Handbook. Students can access grades in the Basic Nursing Skills shell in D2L under the “Grades” tab. A = 90% - 100% B = 80% - 89.99% C = 75% - 79.99% F = 74.99% and below Evaluation: The final grade for this course will be determined as follows: Quizzes and assignments 10% Module exams 65% Final exam 25%_ 100% All completed assignments are to be turned in on the due date unless otherwise indicated. Five points per day will be deducted from late assignments beginning on the due date (including weekends). Quizzes will be either announced or unannounced. Missed quizzes cannot be made up. Other assignments must be turned in at the designated time. Five points will be deducted for each day that an assignment is late, beginning on the due date (including weekends). A zero will be given for each missed quiz or assignment. The lowest one of these grades will be dropped at the end of the course. Module/Final Exams: Exams will be announced. The exams will include information from current and previously covered modules. Exams may not be taken early. Students are expected to be present for all scheduled exams and will not be allowed into the testing area once the exam has started. Please see the tentative course schedule for this course. Missed Exams: Students are expected to be present during all scheduled exams. Exams may not be taken early. If a situation arises that a student is unable to be present to take a scheduled exam, the student must contact the appropriate instructor before the exam is given. Failure to contact the instructor may jeopardize the opportunity to take a make-up exam and result in disciplinary action and a “0” grade on the exam. 3 Missing Exams due to COVID: Students who miss a module exam due to COVID need to contact the appropriate instructor within one week of being cleared to return to campus to arrange a time to make up the missed exam. Make-Up Exam: Exams may not be taken early. If a student arrives after testing has started, the student will be required to schedule a make-up exam. Failure to complete the make-up exam will result in a grade of a zero “0” for that exam. Make-up exams may include an alternate format of questions and scheduled within a set timeframe at the Temple College Testing Center. The student must contact the instructor of the exam the first day the student returns to campus to discuss make-up exam arrangements. Once the agreed upon date and time is determined between the student and instructor, the student must contact the Testing Center to ensure the Center is able to accommodate the proposed date and time. Following, the student must contact the instructor disclosing that the Center has scheduled the exam on the agreed date and time to finalize the exam process. The Final Exam will be comprehensive. The Final Exam has been tentatively scheduled for July 30, 2024, from 8:00 am to 10:00 am. You must be present for the final exam. Students will only be excused by special permission from the Nursing Executive Director. Summer Skills Checkoffs: Skills check-offs for vital signs, physical assessment, and indwelling catheter insertion are a required component of VNSG 1423. Students are required to pass vital sign and physical assessment checkoffs in the nursing simulation lab prior to attending the clinical site on the dates listed on the VNSG 1260 schedule. Students will have the opportunity to practice each skill before checking off on that skill. Students will have a maximum of 3 attempts to successfully check-off on each skill but are expected to be successful on their first attempt. There will be some open lab times available for students who feel they need extra practice time outside the required practice times. A student who does not pass a skill on the first attempt will be required to complete a remediation program prior to attempting the skill a second time. A student who does not pass a skill on the second attempt will be required to complete a remediation program prior to attempting the skill a third time. Remediation and re-check times will be assigned and may include Mondays through Thursdays from 9:00 am-6:00 pm. If a student is absent for any check-off attempts, they will not be allowed to make this up and will count as an attempt. Remediation is required prior to students’ subsequent checkoff(s). Failure to complete the remediation process will result in failure of VNSG 1423: Basic Nursing Skills. Students MUST PASS all skills in order to pass VNSG 1423: Basic Nursing Skills AND VNSG 1260: Clinical-LVN Training I. 4 Occurrence: For all Clinical syllabi/simulation instructions It is the obligation of the Temple College Nursing Program to prepare future nurses to provide quality and safety during all patient interactions.
