Genitourinary and Reproductive System Function and Assessment Objective: Explain the normal structures and functions of the reproductive system. Pages: 839–840 Heading: Female Reproductive System Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Females do have a definite limit to reproductive capability, which ends when ovulation stops (menopause). 2 Mammary glands are considered accessory organs to the reproductive system. 3 The normal pH of the vagina is acidic, not alkaline, which helps retard microbial growth. After puberty, the vagina mucosa is relatively resistant to infection. 4 Internal structures of the female reproductive system include paired ovaries and fallopian tubes, a vagina, and a uterus.

Page: 841 Heading: Male Reproductive System Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The testes are located in the scrotum, which is located between the thighs. The temperature of the scrotum is slightly lower than the body, which is necessary for the production of viable sperm. 2 The male begins to produce sperm after puberty, a process that usually continues throughout the male’s lifetime. 3 The gland secretions in the ejaculate are alkaline to ensure sperm viability in the acidic environment of the female vagina. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 4 During sexual arousal, the arterioles of the penis dilate, the penile sinuses become filled with blood, and the penis becomes firm and erect.

Page: 849 Heading: Mammography Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Digital mammography is more effective in detecting breast cancer in younger women who have denser breast tissue. This is an accurate statement, but there is another statement that more closely addresses the patient’s concern. 2 It is inappropriate for the nurse to make a reference to the cost of the test in relation to the benefit. The patient may feel compelled to make a decision about the type of test based on cost. 3 The most appropriate statement by the nurse is the one that provides a benefit and rationale for the selected method of testing. The computerized imagery is clearer and allows the radiologist to closely examine any specific area. 4 The routine for digital mammography is the same as for previous methods. The time frame is unchanged. The comfort level is unchanged because the breast tissue is still compressed as much as possible. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 4. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 41.

Page: 848 Heading: Breast Self-Examination Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Spiral pattern is an accepted method of breast self-examination. 2 Parallel lines is an accepted method of breast self-examination. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 3 Wheel-spoke pattern is an accepted method of breast self-examination. 4 Whether the breasts are examined in parallel lines, a spiral formation, or a wedge pattern is probably insignificant. It is important, however, to encourage that the examination be methodical and cover all areas of the breast, the tail of Spence, and the axilla. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 5. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 41.

Page: 850 Heading: Bone Health Assessment Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient has numerous risk factors for osteoporosis. A heel scan at the local drug store may serve as a good screening option; however, it is not the most conclusive test for bone density in this client. 2 The DEXA scan measures bone density at the hip or spine, which are areas that are prone to bone loss leading to injuries or joint damage. 3 A laboratory test for estrogen levels is not necessary; the patient is past menopause and estrogen levels are expected to be low unless the patient is on hormone replacement therapy. 4 A blood test for the levels of circulating calcium levels is not effective in determining bone density.

Page: 845 Heading: The Ovarian and Menstrual Cycles Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Client Need: Health Promotion and Maintenance Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The frequency of menstruation is appropriate information for this patient. 2 The length and characteristics of the menstrual cycle is appropriate information Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company for this patient. 3 At this point in time and at the patient’s age, information about the function of hormones is unnecessary. The patient is most likely seeking information about the actual manifestations and related expectations. 4 It is appropriate for the nurse to mention the possibility of cramping and including that it is a manageable condition.

Genitourinary and Reproductive System Function and Assessment Objective: Identify commonly performed tests used to diagnose disorders of the reproductive system. Page: 901 Heading: Male Reproductive System Data Collection Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The HCP provider will defer a needle biopsy until additional laboratory tests are performed. 2 The HCP is most likely to prescribe for a prostatic acid phosphatase test, which will confirm or rule out the presence of prostate cancer. 3 The normal PSA level is less than 4 ng/mL. The patient’s PSA level is significantly elevated and requires intervention. Waiting a year may put the patient at risk for disease or complications related to an enlarged prostate. 4 It is too early to inform the patient of having cancer; additional testing is needed to either confirm or rule out the condition.

Page: 840 Heading: Female Reproductive System Data Collection Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The question is closed ended and will not provide adequate information to add to a function baseline. The question is also very broad. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 2 When gathering data for a normal function baseline, it is not necessary to ascertain the number of sexual partners. The question is inappropriate because it also insinuates the client has had more than one sexual partner. 3 Obtaining a normal function baseline is not the time to ask about treatment of STIs. 4 Asking about changes in sexual functioning and desire is appropriate as deviations from the normal function baseline may be indicative of a hormone imbalance. The expected functioning of the reproductive system changes throughout the process of aging, so the normal function baseline will depend on the patient’s age. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 9.

Page: 911 Heading: Male Reproductive System Data Collection Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Problems (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Identification of a varicocele is done by palpating the spermatic cord. 2 A flashlight and darkened room are not needed for a digital rectal examination and PSA blood test. 3 A simple noninvasive test called transillumination is used to determine if a mass is fluid filled or solid. With the room lights out, a flashlight is held behind the scrotum. If the mass is fluid, a red glow appears; if it is solid, it appears opaque. 4 A flashlight and darkened room are not needed for a digital rectal examination and PSA blood test.

Page: 865 Heading: Diagnostic Tests of the Breast Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Any concern about breast cancer can cause the patient extreme anxiety; the most important care the nurse can provide at this time is presenting a caring and understanding attitude. 2 The HCP has likely provided the reasons for surgical biopsy at the time of obtaining surgical consent; there is no need for the nurse to explain further at this time. 3 It is inappropriate for the nurse to share that most breast biopsies are benign; this is giving the patient false hope. 4 The patient may need some antianxiety medication; however, this is not the most important care the nurse can provide. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 12. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 41. Genitourinary and Reproductive System Function and Assessment Objective: Plan nursing care for patients undergoing each of the diagnostic tests. Page: 850 Heading: Pelvic Examination Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Basic Care and Comfort Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Offering to allow the patient to squeeze the nurse’s hand through the examination is not likely to provide the greatest comfort. In addition, the nurse’s assistance is needed by the HCP. 2 Allowing the patient to remain in a sitting position until the HCP enters the room may or may not provide the patient with comfort. This action can also delay the start of the examination. 3 The suggestion that will provide the patient with the most comfort during a pelvic examination is to instruct the patient to take a deep breath and blow it out as the speculum is inserted. 4 Explaining the details of the examination as it is performed is most commonly done by the HCP. Performance by the nurse is not likely to provide a better sense of comfort. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 13. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 41.

Page: 873 Heading: Endoscopic Examinations Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 There is no need to place the patient on the left side to centralize carbon dioxide. The gas, if used, will be absorbed by the body. 2 There is no need to keep a patient in a supine position, for any amount of time, following a laparoscopy unless the patient had a spinal anesthesia, which was not indicated in this scenario. 3 The patient may experience pain in the neck, shoulders, and upper back following a laparoscopy if carbon dioxide was pumped into the body cavity being examined. The “insufflation” increases the distance between structures for better visualization. 4 The patient will likely have a small dressing on the small incisions that are made in the abdominal wall for the insertion of the endoscope. The procedure is often referred to as “Band Aid” surgery. The presence of infectious drainage would require, at minimum, the use of a wound drainage system. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 15.

Page: 875 Heading: Cytology Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Sexuality Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Conization is a procedure performed to obtain cells from the cervical canal for cytology. 2 An endometrial biopsy involves taking cells from the lining of the uterus using a small spoon-shaped tool called a curet. 3 Extraction of small parts of or an entire lesion is a process to obtain cells for cytology. This procedure can be used at multiple locations. 4 Papanicolaou (PAP) tests are done by gently scraping the cervix to obtain cells from the surface of the cervical canal. The cells are then affixed to a glass slide for cytology. PTS: 1 CON: Sexuality 16. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 41. Genitourinary and Reproductive System Function and Assessment Copyright © 2019 F. A.
