Alignment (Good Posture) 2. Prevention of injuries (Especially back injuries) 4/24/2024 3 PRINCIPLES FOR NURSES • Get help whenever possible • Use leg muscles • Provide stability • Use smooth, coordinated movements • Keep load close to body • Keep load near center of gravity • Pull & pivot ***See Box 18-1*** What’s wrong with this picture? 4/24/2024 4 Body Movement and Alignment for Patients Two basic principles • 1. Maintain correct anatomic position • 2. Change position frequently Hazards of improper alignment • Poor circulation, pressure injuries • Pressure injuries – AKA decubitus ulcers or bedsores • Caused by 1. Pressure 2. Shearing Force 4/24/2024 5 Effects of Immobility Table 39-1, p. 807 & p 806-808 • CARDIOVASCULAR – Venous stasis, blood pressure changes -- leads to thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolus, orthostatic hypotension, increased HR • RESPIRATORY – Stasis of secretions – leads to pneumonia, atelectasis, decreased gas exchange Immobility (cont) • GI – Anorexia, metabolic changes, decreased peristalsis – leads to weight loss, protein deficiency, abdominal distention, constipation • MUSCULOSKELETAL – Decreased muscle and bone mass – Leads to atrophy, weakness, joint contractures, osteoporosis, cramps, foot drop (plantar flexion) 4/24/2024 6 Immobility (cont) • URINARY – Stasis of Urine – Leads to renal (kidney) stones, UTI’s, dysuria • SKIN – Decreased circulation & ischemia and necrosis of tissue– Leads to pressure injuries & skin breakdown • BRAIN – Decreased sensory input and socialization – Leads to disorientation, confusion, depression, anxiety, boredom ASSESSMENT • STANDING Observe for SYMMETRY Head – centered and erect Shoulders & Hips – parallel Knees – slightly flexed Arms – hang at sides Feet – slightly apart for base of support 4/24/2024 7 Correct standing ASSESSMENT Cont. • SITTING – Observe for SYMMETRY Weight – distributed evenly Knees – flexed 90 degrees Feet – rest on floor Arms – rest in lap or armrest 4/24/2024 8 ASSESSMENT (cont) • Ambulating – Observe gait • Is it: • Steady or unsteady? • Even or uneven? • Slow, Moderate or Fast? • Shuffling? • Balanced? If you are ambulating a client and they become dizzy and begin to fall, step behind and pull the client towards you, slide the client down your upper leg, and lower the client gently to the floor. Why it’s important to Change Position: 1. Provides comfort 2. Relieves pressure 3. Prevents problems 4. Improves circulation 4/24/2024 9 Common Positions and Variations Skill 18-1 • Supine • Fowler’s • Semi-Fowler’s • Low Fowler’s • Dorsal recumbent • Lithotomy • Side-lying/lateral • Sims position • Prone • Knee-chest Supine/Prone Position 4/24/2024 10 Low Fowler, Semi-Fowler, Fowler, and High Fowler position Doral Recumbent and Lithotomy Position 4/24/2024 11 Side-Lying/Lateral and Sims Position Common Positioning Devices • Pillows • Boots or splints • Foot boards • Cushioned boots • High-top sneakers • Trapeze bar • Sandbags • Hand rolls • Trochanter rolls • Side rails • Bed board (home use) 4/24/2024 12 4/24/2024 13 List the two main factors in the development of pressure injuries 1. ______________ 2. ______________ The nurse is assisting the physician with a pelvic examination in the office which will include a Pap smear. Which position will be preferred? 1. Dorsal recumbent 2. Lithotomy 3. Knee-chest 4. Sim’s 4/24/2024 14 A patient who has had a stroke is weak on the right side and needs to ambulate for the 1st time 1. The patient should get out of bed on which side? ___ ____________ 2. Before transferring, first let the patient _____ _________ 3. When ambulating the patient, where should the nurse walk in relation to the patient? _______________ 4. This patient would hold a cane on their __ _______________ side","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
