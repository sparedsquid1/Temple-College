Opioid analgesics (8 questions)
Opioid analgesics Uses:: moderate to severe acute/chronic pain, opioid dependence management
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Opioid analgesics Adverse reactions:: sedation, respiratory depression, increased ICP, urinary retention, and constipation
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Opioid analgesics Contraindications
?
- Acute bronchial asthma, emphysema, upper airway obstruction, head injuries, or increased ICP, convulsions, renal/hepatic dysfunction, ulcerative colitis, pregnant or laboring women
- Use cautiously with older adults and pts who have not received opioids yet (“opioid naïve”- at greatest risk for respiratory depression)
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Opioid analgesics Administration
?
- Assess vitals BEFORE and AFTER giving an opioid, especially respirations
- DO NOT GIVE if respiratory rate is less than 12
- If respiratory rate drops after administration, arouse pt and coach their breathing; if it gets below 10 breaths/min, monitor more frequently and notify HCP immediately
- Also get BP, pulse and respiratory rate before administering an antagonist
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Opioid analgesics Transdermal patches
?
- Only one patch at a time, discard old patched in toilet or sharps containers, label new patches, rotate sites, don’t apply over hair, hold for 10-20 seconds, only leave them on for 72 hours; be cautious with heat (teach about no heating pads over patch, no hot tubs, saunas, etc.)
-	Heat increases absorption rate of drug and can cause an overdose
-	Use cautiously with older adults as their subcutaneous tissue is reduced in the aging process
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Extended-release morphine or oxycodone
?
Used for continuous around the clock, given every 8-12 hours, should be swallowed whole
May have fewer adverse reactions with oxycodone than with morphine sulfate
Epidurals: lower total dosages which means fewer adverse reactions, can be bolus for continuous infusion
Risk for respiratory depression; why pts are monitored by apnea monitor for respiratory rate
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Abstinence syndrome s/s
?
Occurs when adults are withdrawing from methadone
-	Early: yawning, tearing, runny nose, sweating
-	Intermediate: pupil dilation, tachycardia, twitching, tremors, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, anorexia
-	Late: muscle spasms, fever, nausea, vomiting, kicking, weakness, depression, body aches, weight loss, severe backache, abdominal and leg pains, hot and cold flashes, insomnia, repetitive sneezing, hypertension, tachypnea, and tachycardia
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Patient controlled analgesia pump (PCA)
?
- Teach how pump works; only pt can press button
- Teach about button and call light; how they’re different
- Can be used to prevent pain; can use when they feel pain will come on
- Only need to press button once
- If pressed too quickly, pt won’t receive pain meds; no risk for overdose
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Nursing Diagnoses
?
- Altered breathing pattern R/T pain and effects on breathing center: teach about coughing and deep breathing every 2 hours, encourage ADLs
- Injury risk R/T dizziness or light-headedness: possible orthostatic hypotension, teach about rising slowly
- Miosis (pinpoint pupils) can cause difficulty seeing; have pt call for assistance when getting up out of bed
- Constipation R/T decreased GI motility: administer stool softener of laxative and increase fluid intake
- Malnutrition R/T anorexia: note food intake, administer possible supplemental nutrition
- Impaired self-ventilation R/T brain response to slow breathing (with naloxone): use cardiac monitoring, oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, have suction readily available to maintain airway
- Acute pain R/T antagonist drug displacing opioid drug at cell receptor sites: remember how pain will come back immediately, monitor fluid intake and output
- Drug tolerance: physical adaptation to drug; greater amounts are needed to achieve the same effects
- Physical dependence: when the body experiences adverse effect when medication is stopped
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

### Chapter 40
#flashcards/Fall24/Pharm/Exam3/Chapter40

Glucose
?

- Normal adult range: 60-100 mg/dL
- Test using a glucometer: teach about cleaning and drying finger, prick side of finger, do not smear blood
- Urine testing isn’t used anymore (it plays a role in identifying kidney involvement or ketone excretion and would need to use the second void, 30 minutes after first void; simply it would take too long)
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

A1C test
?
- Glycosylated hemoglobin test that monitors the average BG level throughout a 3-4 month period; evaluates how successful diabetes treatment is; best way to monitor long term control
- Normal levels are 6.5-7% (indicated good control)
- Poor control: 10% or greater
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Insulin:: hormone produced by beta cells of pancreas; lowers BG levels by inhibiting glucose production; stimulates synthesis of glycogen by liver and promotes protein synthesis and helps body store fat by preventing its breakdown for energy
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Type I:: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); harder to manage
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->
Type II:: non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); more common
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Diabetes Risk factors:: obesity, older age (>40), family hx, gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, limited physical mobility, race/ethnicity
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Can be controled with diet, exercise, and oral antidiabetic drugs
Pregnancy: makes diabetes more difficult to manage
Insulin requirements usually decreases in first tri then increases during second and third
Major symptoms: polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), and polyuria (increased urination); also weight loss
Insulin products
Onset: when insulin first acts in body (make sure pt has food by this time)
Peak: when insulin exerts its max action
Duration: length of time the insulin remains in effect

<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Insulin Contraindications (drugs that affect hypoglycemic effect)
?
- Drugs than may cause the requirement of more insulin: calcitonin, diuretics, epinephrine, estrogens, glucagon, progesterone
- Drugs that may cause the requirement of less insulin: calcium, MAOIs, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, ACE inhibitors, alcohol

Air into long-acting, air into rapid-acting, then draw up regular insulin first, then the long-acting
Rapid-acting= short-acting
NEVER mix or dilute glargine (intermediate) with any other insulin or solution

Insulin Administration
?
- Always use insulin syringes
- Cannot be given orally (it’s a protein and readily destroyed in GI tract)
- Regular insulin is the only type that can be given IV
- Rotate sites (to prevent lipodystrophy: atrophy of subcutaneous fat; appears like “dimpled skin”)
	- This problem can interfere with absorption of insulin
- Monitor for effectiveness of insulin (make sure BG levels came down but didn’t get too low)

Anterior Pituitary Hormones (Adrenocorticotropic hormone)
?
Use: stimulates adrenal cortex to produce and secrete adrenocortical hormones, primarily glucocorticoids
<!--SR:!2024-10-23,1,230-->

Adrenocortical [[Hormones]] ([[Glucocorticoids]])
?
Effect on immune system: decreases production of lymphocytes and eosinophils by atrophy of thymus gland; blocks [[Cytokines]] from being released; decreases B and T lymphocytes
Why it’s good for post-transplant patients
Has huge anti-inflammatory action
Uses: endocrine disorders, rheumatic disorders, collagen diseases, dermatology issues, allergies, ophthalmic diseases, [[Respiratory]] issues, hematologic problems, neoplastic diseases, edematous states, GI diseases, nervous system disorders
Adverse reactions: fluid and [[Electrolyte imbalance]], musculoskeletal disturbances, cardiovascular problems, GI disturbances, dermatologic problems, neurologic disorders, endocrine issues, ophthalmic problems, metabolic issues
May precipitate hyperglycemia, if patients have hidden diabetes
May require more frequent adjustment of dosage
Check [[Blood]] glucose levels frequently
NO LIVE [[Vaccines]] (the vaccine can potentiate virus replication with ACTH, increase adverse reaction to vaccine, and decrease antibody response to vaccine)
DO NOT OMIT DOSE (needs to be given before 9am to precent adrenal suppression)
Alternate day therapy: for long-term therapy; give twice the daily dose every other day before 9am
Monitor for infections (with [[Glucocorticoids]], decreased resistance to infection)
S/S of infection: temperature, sore throat
Monitor for GI bleeding (possible peptic ulcers)
S/S: black or tarry stool, epigastric burning or pain, bloody or coffee ground emesis
Give with full glass of water to decrease GI irritation
Monitor [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/Pre & Co Reqs/Summer 23/Note holder/A & P II/Electrolytes|Electrolytes]] and fluid balance (fluid overload)- especially [[prednisone]]
S/S: edema, weight gain
Monitor strict intake and output, restrict sodium, elevate extremities, possibly get a dietician involved
