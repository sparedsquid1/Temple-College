## Chapter 3
[[Chapter 3.pdf]]

Fertilization
?
- NURSING TIP During sexual counseling, the nurse should emphasize that the survival time of sperm ejaculated into the area of the cervix may be up to 5 days and that pregnancy can occur with intercourse as long as 5 days before ovulation.
- Occurs when a sperm penetrates an ovum and they unite
- Takes place in the outer third of the fallopian tube, near the ovary
- As soon as it occurs, a chemical change in the membrane around the fertilized ovum prevents further sperm from penetrating the ovum
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,271-->

Sex Determination
?
- Sperm can carry either an X or Y [[chromosome]]
- Male determines the gender of the fetus
- pH of female reproductive tract influences survival rate of the X- and Y- bearing sperm, including speed of motility
- XX results in female
- XY results in male
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,271-->

[[Chorion]]:: Embryonic side of placenta

	- [[Human placental lactogen]] (hPL)
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,271-->

[[umbilical cord]]
?
Lifeline between mother and fetus
Two arteries carry [[Blood]] away from fetus
One vein returns [[Blood]] to the fetus
Wharton’s jelly covers and cushions cord vessels
The [[umbilical cord]] is usually inserted near the center of the [[placenta]]
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,260-->

Foramen ovale:: diverts most blood from the right atrium directly to the left atrium, rather than circulating it into the lungs
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,281-->

Ductus Arteriosus:: Diverts most [[Blood]] from the pulmonary artery into the aorta
<!--SR:!2024-12-10,2,281-->

**ACHES** is an acronym used to help individuals recognize potential serious side effects of hormonal contraception (like birth control pills). It stands for:

1. **A** – **Abdominal pain**: This could indicate a serious issue such as a [[Liver]] or [[Gallbladder]] problem, or a [[Blood]] clot in the abdomen.
2. **C** – **Chest pain**: This can be a sign of a [[Blood]] clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or a [[Heart]] attack.
3. **H** – **Headaches (severe)**: Severe headaches, especially sudden and unlike any experienced before, can be a sign of a stroke or high [[Blood]] pressure.
4. **E** – **Eye problems**: [[Vision]] changes or loss of [[Vision]] may indicate a [[Blood]] clot in the eye or a stroke.
5. **S** – **Severe leg pain**: This may be a sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a [[Blood]] clot in the legs.

If someone on hormonal contraception experiences any of these symptoms, it's important to seek medical attention immediately.
