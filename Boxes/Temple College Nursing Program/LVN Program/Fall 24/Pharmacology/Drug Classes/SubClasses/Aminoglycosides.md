### Adverse Reactions 
General system reactions include the following: 
- Nausea 
- Vomiting 
- Anorexia 
- Rash 
- [[Urticaria]] 

More serious adverse reactions may lead to discontinuation of the drug. These reactions include: 
- [[Nephrotoxicity]] 
- [[Ototoxicity ]]
- Neurotoxicity 

[[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] these toxicities are more likely to occur if the client has impaired renal function. Signs and symptoms of [[nephrotoxicity]] may include proteinuria (protein in the urine), hematuria ([[Blood]] in the urine), an increase in the [[Blood]] urea nitrogen ([[BUN]]) level, a decrease in urine output, and an increase in the serum creatinine concentration. [[nephrotoxicity]] is usually reversible once the drug is discontinued. 
Signs and symptoms of [[ototoxicity]] include tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dizziness, roaring in the ears, vertigo, and a mild to severe loss of hearing. If hearing loss occurs, it is usually permanent. [[ototoxicity]] may occur during drug therapy or even after therapy is discontinued. The short-term administration of [[neomycin]] as a preparation for bowel surgery rarely causes these two adverse reactions ([[ototoxicity]] and [[nephrotoxicity]]). 
Signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity include numbness, skin tingling, circumoral (around the [[Mouth]]) paresthesia, peripheral paresthesia, tremors, muscle twitching, convulsions, muscle weakness, and neuromuscular blockade (acute muscular paralysis and apnea). 
The administration of the aminoglycosides may result in a hypersensitivity reaction, which can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, be life-threatening. Mild [[hypersensitivity reactions]] may require only discontinuing the drug, whereas the more serious reactions require immediate treatment. When aminoglycosides are given, individual drug references, such as the cell phone app for your drug handbook or the package insert, should be consulted for more specific adverse reactions. As with other anti-infectives, bacterial or fungal superinfections and [[pseudomembranous colitis]] (see Chapter 9) may occur with the use of these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]].

### Contraindications
The aminoglycosides are contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, preexisting hearing loss, [[myasthenia gravis]], and Parkinson disease. They are also contraindicated during lactation or pregnancy ([[Preg Cat C]], except for [[neomycin]], [[amikacin]], [[gentamicin]], and [[tobramycin]], which are in [[Preg Cat D]]). Aminoglycosides are also contraindicated for long-term therapy, because of the potential for [[ototoxicity]] and [[nephrotoxicity]].
