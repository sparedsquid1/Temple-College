Intrathecal is a fancy word for putting medicine directly into the space around your [[Spinal cord]]. Imagine your [[Spinal cord]] is like a thick, important rope inside your back, and it's surrounded by a special fluid. When doctors need to give you very special medicine to help with certain illnesses or pains, they sometimes need to put the medicine right into that fluid. They do this because it gets the medicine exactly where it needs to go quickly and effectively. So, intrathecal means the medicine is given in a way that goes right to your [[Spinal cord]] area.
