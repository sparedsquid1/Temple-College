**Phenocytocromia** is a condition characterized by the presence of **chromaffin cells** (or **phenochromocytoma cells**) in unusual locations, leading to the abnormal production and release of catecholamines (like [[Epinephrine]] and norepinephrine). These cells are typically found in the adrenal glands but can appear in other locations such as the neck, chest, or abdomen.

The term is not widely used in clinical practice and may be less familiar compared to **[[pheochromocytoma]]**, which is a type of tumor arising from chromaffin cells, commonly found in the adrenal glands and associated with excessive catecholamine production.

### Key Points about Pheochromocytoma

**[[pheochromocytoma]]** is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excess catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as:

- **Hypertension:** Elevated [[Blood]] pressure due to increased levels of catecholamines.
- **Headaches:** Severe and recurrent headaches.
- **Sweating:** Excessive sweating or episodes of diaphoresis.
- **Palpitations:** Rapid or irregular heartbeats.
- **Tremors:** Shaking or trembling.
- **[[anxiety]]:** Feelings of nervousness or panic attacks.

### Diagnosis and Management of Pheochromocytoma

1. **Diagnosis:**
   - **Biochemical Testing:** Measurement of catecholamines and their metabolites in [[Blood]] and urine.
   - **Imaging Studies:** CT scans, MRI, or nuclear medicine scans to locate the tumor.
   - **[[genetic testing]]:** If a hereditary syndrome is suspected, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.

2. **Treatment:**
   - **Surgical Removal:** The primary treatment for [[pheochromocytoma]] is surgical resection of the tumor.
   - **Medications:** Prior to surgery, medications like alpha-blockers are used to manage [[Blood]] pressure and control symptoms.
   - **Follow-up:** Regular monitoring after surgery to check for tumor recurrence or metastasis.
