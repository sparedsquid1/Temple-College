Psychologists also look at ways that people differ in development.

Your consists of the chromosomes inherited from your biological parents, but your actual characteristics you display-results from the interaction of genetics and environmental factors. - a long, thread-like structure composed of twisted parallel strands of DNA; found in the cell nucleus. - deoxyribonucleic acid. The double-stranded molecule that encodes genetic instructions, the chemical basis of heredity. - a unit of DNA on a chromosome that encodes instructions for making a particular protein molecule, the basic unit of heredity. In a nutshell, genes direct the manufacture of proteins. Proteins are used in virtually all of your body's functions-from building cells to manufacturing hormones to regulating brain activity. Your body requires hundreds of thousands of different proteins to function. Each protein is formed by a specific combination of amino acids, and that combination is encoded in a particular gene. At your biological mother's and your biological father's each contributed 23 chromosomes. This set of 23 chromosome pairs represents your unique genotype, or genetic makeup. With the exception of the reproductive cells (sperm or eggs), every cell in your body contains a complete, identical copy of your genotype. Biological sex is determined by the 23rd pair of chromosomes, the While every egg cell has one X chromosome, every sperm cell has either one X or one Y chromosome. Whether a zygote develops into a male or a female depends on whether the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell with a Y chromosome (XY, resulting in a male) or by a sperm cell with an X chromosome (XX, resulting in a female). (p. 300) Page 12 At conception, chromosomes from the biological mother and father combine to form a single cell-the fertilized egg, or Over the relatively brief span of nine months, that single cell develops into the estimated trillion cells that make up a newborn baby. This prenatal stage has three distinct phases: the germinal period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period (p. 302). What are the of prenatal development?

The FAS - Disorders By three weeks after conception, a sheet of primitive neural cells has formed. Just as you might roll a piece of paper to make a tube, this sheet of neural cells curls to form the hollow The neural tube is lined with stem cells, which are cells that can divide indefinitely, renew themselves, and give rise to a variety of other types of cells. At four weeks, this structure is about the size of a grain of salt. At seven weeks it is about a quarter-inch long. The neural stem cells divide and multiply, producing other specialized cells that eventually give rise to neurons and glial cells. Gradually, the top of the neural tube thickens into three bulges that will eventually form the three main regions of the brain: the (p. 303). During peak periods of brain development, new neurons are being generated at the rate of 250,000 per minute. The developing brain cells multiply, differentiate, and begin their migration to their final destination. Guided by the fibers of a special type of glial cell, the newly generated neurons travel to specific locations. They join with other developing neurons and begin forming the structures of the developing nervous system (p. 303). The fetal brain is constantly changing, forming as many as 2 million synaptic connections per second. Connections that are used are strengthened, while connections that remain unused are eventually or eliminated. The fetus now has distinct sleep-wake cycles and periods of activity. During the sixth month, the fetus's brain activity becomes similar to that of a newborn baby (p. 304). Page I 3 What are Rooting reflex - Sucking reflex - Grasping reflex - How do develop after birth? Myth or Fact. It is true that infants, a few hours, after birth, prefer their mothers to strangers. The (vison, hearing, smell, touch) are keenly attuned to people (p. 305). Vision is the last developed sense at birth. The basic sequence of motor development is universal, but the average ages can be different and vary with each infant. From birth, forming close social and emotional relationships with caregivers is essential to the infant's physical and psychological well-being. Although physically helpless, the young infant does not play a passive role in forming these relationships (p. 306). How does influence development? Infants come into the world with very distinct and consistent behavioral styles. Some babies are consistently calm and easy to soothe. Other babies are fussy, irritable, and hard to comfort. Some babies are active and outgoing; others seem shy and wary of new experiences. Psychologists refer to these inborn predispositions to consistently behave and react in a certain way as an infant's temperament. Easy, difficult, slow-to-warm-up (Thomas & Chess, 1977) High-reactive, low-reactive (Kagan, 2010) Because cultural attitudes affect child-rearing practices, infant temperament can also be affected by cultural beliefs (Kagan, 2010a, 2010b). For example, cross-cultural studies of temperament have found that infants in the United States generally displayed more positive emotion than Russian or Asian infants (Molitor & Hsu, 2011). Why? U.S. parents tend to value and encourage expressions of positive emotions, such as smiling and laughing, in their babies. In contrast, parents in other cultures, including those of Russia and many Asian countries, place less emphasis on the importance of positive emotional expression. Thus, the development of temperamental qualities is yet another example of the complex interaction among genetic and environmental factors (p. 308 ).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
