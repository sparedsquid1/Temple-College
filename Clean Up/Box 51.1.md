BOX 51.1 Naming of [[Monoclonal antibodies]] 

When looking at a list of monoclonal antibody names, to the untrained eye, it appears to be an odd assortment of letters. Yet the arrangement of those letters is very specific and designed to help in the understanding of [[Monoclonal antibodies]] naming and function. 

Let us use the example of a drug made to treat [[Leukemia]]: [[rituximab]] (Rituxan). 

This is a drug that can be confused with other [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], therefore part of the name TUX is capitalized to heighten awareness, it does not impact the function of the drug. Monoclonal terminology is built from the back of the word forward. Starting with the end of the word, or suffix, -mab indicates it is a monoclonal antibody. The next one or two letters indicates the type of tissue used to make the mAb. It can be pure tissue or a chimeric, combination of tissue types.
	- o, indicates from mouse tissue 
	- u, indicates from human tissue 
	- xi, combination human and mouse tissue 
	- zu, combination mouse and human, but the majority is human 
	
-xi-mab, this drug is made from a combination of mouse and human tissue. 

We know that [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] made from mouse tissue are more likely to cause a hypersensitive reaction, this portion of the word alerts us to that potential issue. 

The next section of the word indicates the target tissue. It may be 1, 2, or 3 letters. Over time some of the letters have changed. The determination of the letters dealing more with the ability to say the word than the meaning. 
	- ba(c)   =   bacterial 
	- ci(r)   =   cardiovascular 
	- fu(ng)   =   fungal 
	- ki(n)   =   interleukin 
	- li(m)   =   immune system 
	- ne(ur)   =   neural
	- os   =   bone 
	- tox(a)   =   toxin 
	- t(u) a   =   tumor 
	- vi(r)   =   viral 
	
-tu-xi-mab, now means a monoclonal antibody, originating from chimeric tissue, targeting tumor tissue. Lastly, the beginning of the word, or prefix, is what is given to the drug by the manufacturer. Hopefully the letters chosen make the word [[flow]] and easy to say. Ri-tu-xi-mab, a monoclonal antibody, originating from chimeric tissue, to target tumor tissue, it is a drug developed to treat [[Leukemia]].
