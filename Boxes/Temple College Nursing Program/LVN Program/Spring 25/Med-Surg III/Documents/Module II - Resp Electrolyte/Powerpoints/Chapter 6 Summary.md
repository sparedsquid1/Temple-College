- Explain causes and treatments of acid-base imbalances.

#### **Fluid Balance and Regulation**

- **Types of Body Fluids:**
    - Intracellular Fluid
    - Extracellular Fluid (Interstitial, Intravascular, Transcellular)
- **Mechanisms Controlling Fluid Balance:**
    - Pressure sensors
    - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)

#### **Movement of Fluids and Electrolytes**

- **Active Transport:** Requires energy to move substances.
- **Passive Transport:** Includes diffusion, osmosis, and filtration.
- **Tonicity:**
    - Isotonic: Same osmolarity as [[Blood]].
    - Hypertonic: Higher osmolarity than [[Blood]].
    - Hypotonic: Lower osmolarity than [[Blood]].

#### **Fluid Gains and Losses**

- **Sources of Fluid Gain:** Food and fluids.
- **Sources of Fluid Loss:**
    - **Sensible Losses:** Measurable (urine, sweat).
    - **Insensible Losses:** Non-measurable (respiration, evaporation).

#### **Fluid Imbalances**

- **Dehydration & Hypovolemia:**
    - Signs: Thirst, rapid weak pulse, low BP, dry skin, skin tenting, decreased urine output.
    - Interventions: Increase fluids, monitor weight & I/O, caution with elderly.
- **Fluid Overload (Hypervolemia):**
    - Signs: Bounding pulse, high BP, edema, [[Respiratory]] changes.
    - Interventions: Restrict sodium/fluids, administer [[Diuretics]], monitor weight.

#### **Electrolyte Imbalances**

- **Sodium (Na+):**
    
    - **Hyponatremia (<135 mEq/L):** Mental status changes, nausea, weakness.
    - **Hypernatremia (>145 mEq/L):** Thirst, confusion, seizures, muscle weakness.
- **Potassium (K+):**
    
    - **Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L):** Muscle weakness, arrhythmias, shallow breathing.
    - **Hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/L):** Muscle cramps, diarrhea, cardiac arrest.
- **Calcium (Ca++):**
    
    - **Hypocalcemia (<9 mg/dL):** Tetany, Chvostek’s & Trousseau’s signs, arrhythmias.
    - **Hypercalcemia (>11 mg/dL):** Weak muscles, constipation, kidney stones.
- **Magnesium (Mg++):**
    
    - **Hypomagnesemia (<1.5 mEq/L):** Arrhythmias, muscle spasms, hyperreflexia.
    - **Hypermagnesemia (>2.5 mEq/L):** Lethargy, [[Respiratory]] [[Depression]], hypotension.

#### **Acid–Base Balance**

- **Normal pH:** 7.35–7.45.
- **Regulation:** Cellular buffers, lungs (CO2), kidneys (bicarbonate).
- **Imbalances:**
    - **Acidosis:** [[Respiratory]] (hypoventilation), Metabolic (kidney dysfunction, diarrhea).
    - **Alkalosis:** [[Respiratory]] (hyperventilation), Metabolic (vomiting, [[Diuretics]]).
