July/August 2021 www.NursingMadeIncrediblyEasy.com Patient falls are a common but prevent- able problem in hospitals. Approximately 30% of inpatient falls result in injury, and injurious falls increase patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Patient falls are considered a nursing-sensitive outcome because their incidence has been linked to the quality of nursing care. The reasons why patients fall and fall preven- tion strategies in hospitals have been a focus of research for over 6 decades and the evidence has been evaluated in sys- tematic reviews and meta-analyses. De- spite decades of research and a growing body of evidence for prevention, many hospital-based fall prevention programs are locally developed, use unreliable as- sessment tools, and don’t leverage exist- ing evidence. This article examines the science of fall prevention in hospitals and makes recom- mendations for implementing and adopt- ing a patient-centered and evidence-based fall prevention program. Literature review Over 90% of falls in hospitals are pre- ventable. Preventable falls include ac- cidental falls and anticipated physiologic falls. Accidental falls are caused by environmental hazards, such as spills, cluttered rooms, improper footwear, and patients unable to get help when needed. These falls can be prevented by apply- ing universal safety precautions for all patients, including wiping up spills, maintaining a clear path to the bathroom, providing safe slippers, and ensuring patient access to the call system. Antici- pated physiologic falls are caused by a patient’s physical condition, and these falls are prevented by conducting a fall risk assessment, developing a personal- ized fall prevention plan, and communi- cating the plan to all key stakeholders to address patient-specific risk factors. Unanticipated physiologic falls are caused by an unknown or emergent medi- cal condition, such as a new-onset seizure, heart attack, or stroke and may not be pre- ventable. However, unanticipated physi- ologic falls account for fewer than 10% of falls in hospitals; once the cause is known, a plan can be developed so future falls can be prevented. Hospital-based fall prevention research before 2000 focused mainly on determin- ing risk factors for falling and developing screening tools to identify patients prone to falls. As a result, the factors that place patients at risk for falls in the hospital are well established and there are many screening tools to identify fall-prone patients. The most common risk factors for falls in hospitals are a previous history of falling; gait instability; lower limb weak- ness; urinary incontinence or frequency Patient-centered fall prevention By Patricia C.

Most fall risk screening tools are com- prised of a subset of these factors and were developed using varying levels of rigor. Previous studies have tested and compared the accuracy of the different screening tools, but often the methods used were flawed, contributing to uncertainty as to which fall risk screening tool should be used in hospi- tal settings. It’s important to note that risk assessment helps identify fall risk factors but doesn’t prevent falls. Evidence from studies published from 2009 to the present suggests that fall preven- tion is a three-step process comprised of completing a fall risk assessment, develop- ing a tailored or personalized fall preven- tion plan, and consistently implementing the plan. It’s important to choose a fall risk screening scale that’s accurate and compre- hensive, which can be completed quickly at the bedside involving the patient. This will provide the information that nurses need to develop an initial fall prevention plan on admission that’s tailored to patient- specific risk factors. Regular reassessment will aid in refining the fall prevention plan over the course of a patient’s hospitalization as potential risks for falling may emerge. Recent evidence also suggests that patient engagement in all three steps of the fall pre- vention process prevents falls and related injuries. Patients who are engaged in the three-step fall prevention process are knowl- edgeable about their personal risks of fall- ing and their personal fall prevention plan. Patients are then able to partner with the care team to ensure that their fall prevention plan is consistently carried out correctly. The Fall TIPS tool kit From 2007 to 2009, our team developed the Fall TIPS (Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety) tool kit to integrate the three-step fall prevention process into practice. For step 1, assessment, we used the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) because this scale addresses all six common predictors of falls when used properly. In addition, the MFS was rigorously developed, is accurate, and can be completed quickly at the bedside with the patient. We con- ducted focus groups with nurses, other professional and paraprofessional provid- ers, and patients to identify interventions to address each risk factor. We developed the Fall TIPS clinical deci- sion support (CDS) in the electronic health record (EHR) to automatically link each MFS risk factor to evidence-based interven- tions that are both effective and feasible in hospital settings. As the nurse completes the MFS in the EHR, an evidence-based plan is automatically developed to address each risk factor. The plan uses icons to display Figure 1: EHR Fall TIPS poster Call, Don’t Fall! Avoid Slips, Trips, and Broken Hips!

We also developed a low-tech version of the poster that uses color to link the MFS risk factors to evidence-based interventions (see Fall TIPS laminated paper poster). In a series of clinical trials involving over 40,000 patients, the Fall TIPS tool kit was associated with a significant decrease in falls and fall-related injuries. The Fall TIPS tool kit includes a suite of tools to promote adoption and spread of evidence-based fall prevention best practices (see The Fall TIPS tool kit). It’s used in over 200 hospitals in the US and around the world, supported by over a decade of research, and described in more than 20 peer-reviewed manuscripts (www. FallTIPS.org/resources/publications). The Fall TIPS tool kit is freely available online at www.FallTIPS.org. Common barriers to fall prevention and recommendations An overarching barrier to fall prevention in hospitals is the tendency to develop local fall prevention programs rather than adopt an existing evidence-based program. The following three areas are particularly problematic. Barrier: Use of fall risk assessment tools that aren’t scientifically valid and don’t inform interventions. The fall risk assessment is the foundation of an evidence-based fall prevention plan. Using risk assessment tools that don’t address the six common reasons patients fall in hospitals will lead to gaps in the Figure 2: Fall TIPS laminated paper poster Patient Name: John Date: 05/12/2016 Increased Risk of Harm If You Fall Fall Interventions Communicate Recent Fall and/or Risk of Harm IV Assistance When Walking Bed Alarm On Assistance Out of Bed Bed Rest 1 person 2 people CaneCrutches Walking Aids Walker hoursToileting Schedule: Every Bed Pan Assist to Commode Assist to Bathroom (Circle selection based on color) (Check all that apply) History of Falls Medication Side Effects Walking Aid IV Pole or Equipment Unsteady Walk May Forget or Choose Not to Call Fall Risks Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In addition, many existing tools aren’t parsimonious; they include risk factors that aren’t actionable. These take more time to complete but don’t support the prevention plan. Recommendation: Select a fall risk assessment tool that’s scientifically valid and comprehensive (includes all the com- mon predictors of falls), doesn’t include nonmodifiable risk factors, and can be completed quickly and accurately at the bedside. Some EHR vendors can prepopu- late the fall risk assessment scale with EHR data, but the patient’s fall risks and fall prevention plan should always be reviewed and refined based on nursing judgment to develop the tailored preven- tion plan with the patient. Barrier: Labeling patients as low-, medi- um-, or high-risk leads to generic preven- tion plans that don’t protect the patient. For example, “high risk of falls” signs and other generic indicators of fall risk, such as yel- low socks or wristbands, don’t tell staff why the patient is at risk and what should be done to prevent a fall. Further, on medical units, most patients are high-risk, so these signs become “noise” in the environment. Patients at risk due to a gait disturbance require different interventions than patients with a cognitive disturbance. Applying a fall prevention bundle to all patients at high risk for falls requires a long list of interven- tions, many of which aren’t applicable to a specific patient and may needlessly tax hospital staffing resources. Also problematic is the practice of using bed alarms for all patients at high risk for falls. Bed alarms are only appropriate for patients who can’t reli- ably call for help. For all other patients, they create needless noise in the environment and can result in alarm fatigue. Recommendation: Don’t label patients as low-, medium-, or high-risk because even low-risk patients fall. Instead, adopt practic- es that identify patient-specific risk factors. If a patient has just one risk factor, we’re still obligated to implement a personalized intervention to prevent a fall related to that risk factor. The nurse, care team, and patient, as well as family members if available, should know the patient’s risk factors and how to pre- vent those risk factors from causing a fall. Barrier: Lack of patient and family engagement in the three-step fall preven- tion process. Recommendation: Engage patients in all three steps of the fall prevention process. Patient engagement in fall risk assessment ensures that patients know their risk fac- tors for falling and believe those risks may cause them to fall unless they follow their fall prevention plan. This is especially important for younger patients and those who aren’t at risk for falling at home and don’t believe they’re at risk for falling while in the hospital. Patient engagement in devel- oping the prevention plan ensures that patients understand what they should or shouldn’t do and partner with the nurse and care team to accurately and con- sistently carry out their plan. Final thoughts Patient falls in hospitals are a persistent problem; however, falls are preventable by engaging patients and their families in the three-step fall prevention process. Evidence-based tools are available to help nurses implement an effective and sustainable fall prevention program. ■ REFERENCES Burns Z, Khasnabish S, Hurley AC, et al.
