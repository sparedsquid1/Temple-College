**Behçet's Disease** is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder that affects multiple parts of the body, including the [[Blood]] vessels, skin, eyes, joints, and mucous membranes. It is considered an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.

### Key Features of Behçet's Disease:
1. **Oral Ulcers:** Painful sores in the [[Mouth]] are one of the most common symptoms and often the first sign of the disease.
   
2. **Genital Ulcers:** Similar to oral ulcers, these can be painful and recurrent.

3. **Skin Lesions:** These may appear as acne-like sores, red nodules, or other types of rashes.

4. **Eye Inflammation:** This can include uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye), which can cause pain, redness, and [[Vision]] problems.

5. **Joint Pain:** Many people with Behçet's experience arthritis, particularly in the knees and ankles.

6. **Vascular Involvement:** Behçet's can cause inflammation in both veins and arteries, leading to [[Blood]] clots, aneurysms, and other vascular complications.

7. **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Inflammation of the [[Digestive]] tract can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues.

8. **Neurological Involvement:** In rare cases, Behçet's can affect the brain and nervous system, leading to symptoms like headaches, confusion, and stroke-like events.

### Causes and Risk Factors:
- The exact cause of Behçet's disease is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors.
- Certain genes, such as HLA-B51, are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease.
- The condition is more common in people from the Middle East, East Asia, and the Mediterranean region.

### Diagnosis:
Diagnosing Behçet's disease can be challenging because its symptoms overlap with those of many other conditions. There is no specific test for Behçet's; diagnosis is usually based on clinical criteria, including the presence of recurrent oral ulcers and at least two other symptoms (e.g., genital ulcers, eye inflammation, or skin lesions).

### Treatment:
There is no cure for Behçet's disease, but treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options may include:

- **[[Corticosteroids]]:** To reduce inflammation.
- **Immunosuppressive [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]:** Such as azathioprine or [[cyclosporine]], to help control the immune system.
- **[[colchicine]]:** Often used to treat joint pain and skin symptoms.
- **Biologic Therapies:** Such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., [[infliximab]]) may be used in severe cases, particularly for eye or neurological involvement.

### Prognosis:
The course of Behçet's disease varies widely among individuals. Some people experience mild symptoms that come and go, while others may have more severe and persistent issues. With proper management, many people with Behçet's disease can lead relatively normal lives. However, the disease can sometimes lead to serious complications, especially if it affects major organs.
