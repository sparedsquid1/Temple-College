The nurse is administering pravastatin and amiodarone to a client with cardiac issues. Which potential interaction will the nurse carefully monitor the client for? A) Increased anticoagulant effect B) Increased hypoglycemic effect C) Increased risk of myopathy D) Decreased effects of pravastatin Answer: C Rationale: When the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin is administered with amiodarone, the nurse should monitor the client for increased risk of myopathy as an effect of the interaction between the two drugs. Increased anticoagulant effect is observed in clients receiving warfarin along with pravastatin. Increased hypoglycemic effects are observed in clients receiving sulfonylureas with fibric acid derivatives. The interaction of pravastatin with amiodarone does not decrease the effect of pravastatin.

A client prescribed niacin reports significant skin flushing and itching, stating, \"I almost stopped taking the drug.\" The nurse anticipates the health care provider will prescribe which drug to address this issue? A) Prednisone B) Aspirin C) Ibuprofen D) Hydrocortisone Answer: B Rationale: Aspirin may be recommended before taking niacin preparations to reduce adverse reactions when niacin causes skin reactions that are severe or cause extreme discomfort. The concomitant use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) and bile acid resins will decrease the serum level or decrease the GI absorption of the NSAID. There can be decreased serum levels of hydrocortisone when they are taken with bile acid resins. There is no recognized reaction between prednisone and niacin.

The client presents for a routine clink visit to evaluate the long-term use of cholestyramine. The health care provider determines vitamin A and D should be prescribed at this time. The nurse determines which nursing diagnose is most appropriate at this time? A) Risk for impaired skin integrity B) Constipation C) Risk for injury D) Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements Answer: D Rationale: Bile acid resins may interfere with the digestion of fats and prevent the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and folic acid. Therefore, the nursing diagnosis of risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements would be most appropriate. Adverse reactions associated with nicotinic acid such as flushing would suggest a risk for impaired skin integrity. Constipation would be associated with statin therapy. Risk for injury may be appropriate for clients taking fibrates or statins.

A nursing instructor is teaching a class on the action of statin drugs. The instructor determines the class is successful after the students correctly choose which actions? Select all that apply. A) Decrease cholesterol absorption in GI tract B) Promote cholesterol breakdown C) Formation of a substance excreted in the feces D) Decrease breakdown of fat to cholesterol E) Inhibit cholesterol production Answer: A, B, E Rationale: Statins inhibit the manufacture or production of cholesterol or promote the breakdown of cholesterol. The bile acid resins bind to bile acids to form an insoluble substance that cannot be absorbed by the intestine, so it is excreted in the feces. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 33 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 417, HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors 15. A client is questioning the new prescription for a statin. The nurse should point out that statin will reduce the risk of which disorder(s) for the client? Select all that apply. A) Stroke B) Transient ischemic attack C) Kidney disease D) Hepatic disease E) Cancer Answer: A, B Rationale: The use of statins in clients with hyperlipidemia with or without clinically evident coronary heart disease can reduce the risk of death from stroke and transient ischemic attacks. Individuals with kidney disease should use bile acid resin antihyperlipidemic drugs cautiously. Statins are contraindicated in individuals with severe hepatic disease. Whether a client with cancer could use a statin would depend on the location of the cancer and would be decided on a case-by-case manner.

The nurse is preparing to administer cholestyramine to a client. On preadministration assessment, the nurse discovers the client is currently taking propranolol, glipizide, and acetaminophen. Which potential interaction(s) should the nurse prioritize? Select all that apply. A) Hypoglycemia B) Decreased analgesia C) Increase in blood pressure D) Hypotension E) Hyperglycemia Answer: C, E Rationale: The use of bile acid resins, like cholestyramine, decreases the absorption of some medications including glipizide and propranolol. This decreased absorption could result in hyperglycemia (not hypoglycemia) and an increase in blood pressure (not hypotension) for this particular client. There should not be any interaction between the acetaminophen and cholestyramine. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 33 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 424, Bile Acid Resins 21. The nurse is preparing a teaching session for a client prescribed gemfibrozil. The nurse will point out the drug operates via which mechanism(s)? Select all that apply. A) Increases excretion of cholesterol B) Reduces VLDLs C) Increases breakdown of VLDLs D) Reduces production of triglycerides E) Inhibits cholesterol formation Answer: A, D Rationale: Gemfibrozil increases the excretions of cholesterol and reduces the production of triglycerides. The drug does not reduce VLDLs, increase VLDL breakdown, or inhibit cholesterol formation. Fenofibrate will help decrease VLDLs. Statins will assist with the breakdown of VLDLs. Cholesterol formation is inhibited by PCSK9 inhibitors.

The nurse is conducting an ongoing assessment on a client who was administered an antihyperlipidemic medication. Which assessment(s) should the nurse prioritize? Select all that apply. A) Blood glucose B) Vital signs C) Assessment of bowel function D) Input and output E) Stool sample Answer: B, C Rationale: Clients on antihyperlipidemic medications should have vital signs checked and bowel function assessed because an adverse reaction to these drugs is constipation. Constipation may become serious if not treated early in the medication regimen. Blood glucose will be important for clients with diabetes. These individuals should use bile acid resins cautiously. Clients should be instructed to increase intake to help avoid constipation. One way to monitor this would be to keep I&O. Stool sample would not be needed; however, should monitor for potential stool softener use due to constipation. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 33 Learning Objective: 4 Cognitive Level: Apply Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 422, Ongoing Assessment 25. The nurse is evaluating the client's response to colestipol on a follow-up visit. Which suggestion(s) should the nurse prioritize making after the client reports constipation? Select all that apply. A) Stop taking the antihyperlipidemic medication. B) Increase your fluid intake. C) Eat foods rich in dietary fiber. D) Be sure to exercise every day. E) Use a stool softener. Answer: B, C, D, E Rationale: Constipation resulting from an antihyperlipidemic drug can be treated by increasing fluid intake, consuming food rich in dietary fiber, exercising daily, and using a stool softener or laxative if needed. Stopping the antihyperlipidemic medication would be inappropriate especially if the lipid levels are still elevated. The health care provider may choose to change to a different medication.
