**Kinase inhibitors** are a class of [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] that block the activity of one or more protein kinases. Protein kinases are enzymes that modify other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups, a process called phosphorylation. This process plays a crucial role in various cellular activities, including cell signaling, growth, and division. Aberrant kinase activity is often linked to cancer and other diseases, making kinase inhibitors a valuable tool in targeted therapies.

### Types of Kinases Targeted:
- **Tyrosine Kinases:** These are enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins. Abnormal tyrosine kinase activity is implicated in various cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ([[Tyrosine Kinase-EGFR Inhibitors]]) are among the most common kinase inhibitors.
  
- **Serine/Threonine Kinases:** These kinases phosphorylate serine or threonine residues on target proteins. They are involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.

- **Dual-Specificity Kinases:** These can phosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues.

### Interactions:
- Kinase inhibitors work by binding to the kinase enzyme and blocking its ability to phosphorylate target proteins. This inhibition can disrupt the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth and survival.

### Commonly Used Kinase Inhibitors:

1. **[[imatinib]] (Gleevec):** One of the first successful kinase inhibitors, [[imatinib]] targets the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, which is a fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia [[chromosome]] abnormality in chronic myeloid [[Leukemia]] ([[chronic myelocytic leukemia]]). It also inhibits other kinases like KIT and PDGFR.

2. **[[erlotinib]] (Tarceva) and [[gefitinib]] (Iressa):** These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] inhibit the [[EGFR Inhibitors]] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase and are used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ([[nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer]]) with EGFR mutations.

3. **[[sorafenib]] (Nexavar):** A multi-kinase inhibitor that targets several kinases involved in tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. It is used in the treatment of advanced renal cell [[Carcinoma]] and hepatocellular [[Carcinoma]].

4. **[[lapatinib]] (Tykerb):** Targets both EGFR and [[HER2-positive breast]]/neu tyrosine kinases and is used in the treatment of [[HER2-positive breast]]-positive breast cancer.

5. **[[vemurafenib]] (Zelboraf):** Inhibits the BRAF V600E mutation, commonly found in [[Melanoma]]. It is used in the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutated [[Melanoma]].

6. **[[palbociclib]] (Ibrance):** Inhibits CDK4 and CDK6, which are serine/threonine kinases involved in cell cycle regulation. It is used in combination with hormonal therapy for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, [[HER2-positive breast]]-negative breast cancer.

### Clinical Uses:
- **Cancer Treatment:** Kinase inhibitors are predominantly used in oncology to treat various cancers by targeting specific kinases involved in tumor growth and metastasis.
- **Chronic Inflammatory Diseases:** Some kinase inhibitors are being explored for use in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Research is ongoing to explore the use of kinase inhibitors in conditions like hypertension and [[Heart]] failure.

### Side Effects:
- Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, and, depending on the specific kinase targeted, more serious effects like cardiotoxicity, [[Hepatotoxicity]], or bone marrow suppression.

### Resistance:
- One challenge with kinase inhibitors is the development of resistance, where cancer cells adapt to the presence of the inhibitor and continue to proliferate. This has led to the development of second- and third-generation kinase inhibitors designed to overcome resistance mechanisms.

Kinase inhibitors represent a critical component of precision medicine, offering targeted treatment options that are tailored to the molecular characteristics of an individual's disease.
