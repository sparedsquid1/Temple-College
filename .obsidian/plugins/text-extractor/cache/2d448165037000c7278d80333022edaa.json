Functions of Intestines Feces- intestinal waste  Stored in the sigmoid colon until the gastrocolic reflex moves it into the rectum through the anus (defecation) Valsalva maneuver  Intra-abdomen pressure, tightening abdomen muscles, increases when hold breath and push down Defecation  Voluntary control  Uses valsalva maneuver to expel feces  The slower transport allows reabsorption of minerals, electrolytes, and water.  The pH continues to become more alkaline to neutralize the acid waste left by the digestive bacteria.  The mucus secreted in the large bowel is sticky and allows the feces to form a solid mass. 5 6 5/26/2024 4 Effects of Aging on the Intestinal Tract  Atrophy of the villi  Decreased absorption of fats and vitamin B12  Decrease in motility  Bowel habits should not change in the normal healthy individual Characteristics of Stool Normal Stool  Color: light to dark brown  Consistency: soft, formed  Consists of ¼ solids and ¾ water  Appearance: affected by diet and metabolism  Composition: solid materials consist of 70% undigested roughage from carbohydrates, fat, protein, and inorganic matter, and 30% dead bacteria  The chemical waste formed by intestinal bacteria gives off fecal odor in the form of gas that is expelled as flatus. 7 8 5/26/2024 5 Characteristics of Stool Abnormal Stool Blood in the stool: most serious abnormality • Fresh red blood: bleeding in colon • Occult: upper GI bleed (black tarry stool called melena) • A rule of thumb: • the brighter the blood, the lower the bleeding source. • Occult blood turns black due to the digestive process of the upper GI tract. • Occult blood is not always obvious. It may give off a faint odor of blood but usually needs to be tested. • Guaiac Test Characteristics of Stool  Pale white or light gray stool: absence of bile in the intestine  Large amounts of mucus – irritation or inflammation of intestines  Fat – foul smelling, floats  Pus- inflamed or infected ulcer  Parasites – tapeworm or pinworm 9 10 5/26/2024 6 Promoting Regular Bowel Elimination Defecate when the need arisesDefecateDefecate Consume high fiber diet, low fat dietConsumeConsume Drink at least eight 8oz glasses of liquid each dayDrinkDrink Exercise every dayExerciseExercise Attempt to defecate 30 minutes after mealsAttemptAttempt Drink hot cup of coffee, hot water with lemon, or prune juiceDrinkDrink Establish a pattern by attempting to defecate at the same time each day EstablishEstablish 11 12 5/26/2024 7 Hypoactive Bowel and Constipation Hypoactive Bowel Indicates a decrease in peristalsis •Causes •Immobility •Injury to the bowel •Drugs •Surgery •Restricted to bed at risk for constipation •Flatus (gas) accumulates in the intestinal tract when peristalsis reduced or absent Usually results in constipation Hypoactive Bowel and Constipation Drugs - Contribute to Constipation  Narcotic analgesics  Codeine, Morphine, Meperidine  General anesthetics  Diuretics  Sedatives  Anticholinergics  Calcium channel blockers Nursing interventions to minimize constipating effects of these medications  Increase fluid intake to 1500 mL/day  Encourage walking & abdominal muscle-setting exercise  Consume high fiber, low fat diet 13 14 5/26/2024 8 Hypoactive Bowel and Constipation Drugs Used for Constipation • Stool softeners • Colace, Surfak, Dialose, MiraLax • Bulk-forming laxatives • Fibercon, Metamucil, Citrucel • Large amount of fluid should be taken with these to prevent constipation • Irritant/stimulant laxatives • Dulcolax, Neolid, Ex-Lax, Correctol, Senokot • Saline laxatives • Citrate of magnesia, milk of magnesia, phospho-soda Hyperactive Bowel and Diarrhea Hyperactive Bowel  Increase in peristalsis  Usually results in diarrhea  Causes  Inflammation of GI tract, infectious diseases, diseases such as:  Diverticulitis  Ulcerative colitis  Crohn’s disease  Drugs  Some antibiotics kill normal bowel bacteria, resulting in diarrhea  Patients who experience diarrhea from antibiotics should replace normal flora by:  Eating yogurt  Drinking buttermilk  Take probiotics 15 16 5/26/2024 9 Hyperactive Bowel and Diarrhea Medications Used to Control Diarrhea  Diphenoxylate hydrochloride with atropine sulfate (Lomotil)  Loperamide hydrochloride (Imodium)  Difenoxin hydrochloride with atropine sulfate (Motofen) Major Problem Resulting From Diarrhea ❖ Fluid and Electrolyte Loss Fecal Incontinence Fecal Incontinence  Lack of voluntary control of fecal evacuation; inability to retain feces  Causes  Illness  Cerebrovascular accident  Traumatic injury  Neurogenic dysfunction  Distressing condition that causes a loss of dignity  Feelings of being less of a person  Loss of self-respect  Embarrassed  Anxiety or fear of losing control 17 18 5/26/2024 10 Nursing Process Initial Assessment  Does the patient have a bowel problem?

All rights reserved. Question 2 Barbara’s patient is trying to understand the difference between an ileostomy and a colostomy. Barbara explains to her patient: 1) an ileostomy is an opening into the colon and a colostomy is an opening into the ileum. 2) an ileostomy has more effluent than a colostomy, which has more liquid fecal matter. 3) an ileostomy has more liquid effluent and a colostomy has effluent that is more formed. 4) diet will not adversely affect the ileostomy or colostomy patient.
