A client has been admitted to a health care center with reports of dyspnea. The nurse suspects left-sided heart failure based on which assessment finding? A) Nocturia B) Pitting edema C) Weight gain D) Orthopnea Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should assess for orthopnea in clients with left-sided heart failure. Orthopnea is a condition where the client has difficulty breathing when lying down. The other features of left ventricular failure include a hacking cough or wheezing, restlessness, and anxiety. Nocturia, pitting edema, and weight gain are associated with right-sided heart failure.

A nurse is preparing to administer ivabradine to a client with heart failure. Which preadministration assessment should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Inspect joints for swelling. B) Check for jugular vein distention. C) Inspect skin for rash. D) Obtain blood glucose levels. Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should check for jugular vein distention as part of the preadministration assessment for the client prescribed a cardiotonic. Inspecting the joints for swelling should occur on the ongoing assessment to evaluate for possible adverse reactions, especially if the client is also receiving a diuretic. Inspecting the skin would be necessary if there were any indications of a possible adverse reaction, but this would also occur after the drug's administration. Obtaining blood glucose levels is not necessary for heart failure but would be indicated if the client also had diabetes.

The nurse is completing a teaching session with a client with heart failure. The nurse determines that additional teaching is needed about the cardiotonic drug therapy when the client makes which comment? A) “I will take the drug at the same time each day.” B) “I can crush the tablet and mix it with food.” C) “I should call if my pulse rate is below 80 beats per minute.” D) “I need to notify my health care provider if I have blurred vision.” Answer: C Rationale: Cardiotonics normally should be withheld if the pulse rate is below 60 bpm or above 100 bpm. The client should take the drug at the same time each day, crush the tablet and mix with food, and notify the primary health care provider if blurred vision occurs.

A client with arrhythmias is prescribed an antiarrhythmic. About which finding on the ongoing assessment should the nurse instruct the client to immediately notify the primary health care provider? A) Sudden change in mental state B) A pulse rate of 90 bpm C) Dry mouth and gums D) Increased restlessness Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should report any sudden change in mental status to the health care provider as a decrease in dosage may be necessary. A pulse rate above 100 bpm or below 60 bpm should be immediately reported to the health care provider. Dry mouth and gums are expected adverse reactions for which the nurse should recommend the client take frequent sips of water or chew sugarless gum. Somnolence—not restlessness—is a possible adverse reaction to antiarrhythmic drugs.

A client on antiarrhythmic drug therapy reports nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a ringing sensation in the ears. Which drug should the nurse investigate first to determine possible cause? A) Lidocaine B) Quinidine C) Flecainide D) Procainamide Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should consider the drug quinidine as the cause for these adverse reactions. Some of the symptoms of toxicity include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, vertigo, and lightheadedness. Lidocaine, flecainide, and procainamide do not cause tinnitus or hearing loss.

A client admitted to a health care facility with cardiac arrhythmia is prescribed propranolol. Which signs should the nurse prioritize on the ongoing assessment? A) Pulse rate B) Tendon reflexes C) Hydration D) Visual acuity Answer: A Rationale: During antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the nurse should closely monitor the client's pulse rate. A change in the pulse rate and rhythm will help the nurse assess a response to drug therapy, the development of signs of heart failure, the development of a new cardiac arrhythmia, or worsening of the arrhythmia being treated. It is not necessary to monitor the tendon reflexes, hydration, or visual acuity when administering an antiarrhythmic drug to the client.

A nurse is studying a journal article about propranolol. Which factor(s) would the nurse expect to find explained? Select all that apply. A) Is a class III antiarrhythmic B) Acts by blocking β-adrenergic receptors of the heart and kidney C) Reduces the release of renin D) Increases excitability of the heart E) Has membrane-stabilizing effects Answer: B, C, E Rationale: Propranolol is a class II antiarrhythmic that acts by blocking β-adrenergic receptors of the heart and kidney, reducing the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on these areas, and decreasing the excitability of the heart and the release of renin. Propranolol also has membrane-stabilizing effects. Question format: Multiple Select Chapter: 37 Learning Objective: 3 Cognitive Level: Understand Client Needs: Physiological Integrity: Pharmacological Therapies Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-solving Process (Nursing Process) Reference: p. 479, Class II—β-Adrenergic Blockers 15. A nursing student is preparing a presentation detailing verapamil. The student should be prepared to explain which effect(s) verapamil has on the cardiovascular system? Select all that apply. A) Reduces the release of renin B) Dilates coronary arteries C) Dilates peripheral arteries D) Slows conduction through the SA and AV nodes E) Membrane-stabilizing effects Answer: B, C, D Rationale: Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker. These drugs inhibit the movement of calcium through channels across the myocardial cell membranes and vascular smooth muscle. Cardiac and vascular smooth muscles depend on the movement of calcium ions into the muscle cells through specific ion channels. When this movement is inhibited, the coronary and peripheral arteries dilate, thereby decreasing the force of cardiac contraction. This drug also reduces heart rate by slowing conduction through the SA and AV nodes.

The nurse is caring for a client admitted to the telemetry unit with atrial fibrillation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. The nurse should perform which assessment(s) for safe administration of the first dose of quinidine? Select all that apply. A) Obtain a history of allergies to medications and specific reactions. B) Assess if the client has systemic lupus erythematosus or myasthenia gravis. C) Check baseline renal and hepatic function before administering drug. D) After administration, assess for tinnitus, hearing loss, headache, vertigo. E) Determine if the client has had grapefruit or grapefruit juice recently. Answer: A, B, C, D Rationale: Before administering the first dose of quinidine, the nurse should assess baseline vitals with apical pulse, and baseline focused respiratory and cardiac assessments. The nurse should obtain a history of allergies to medications, and what symptoms occurred for a specific reaction. Asking if the client has lupus or myasthenia gravis, both contraindications to the drug, is important because quinidine will increase the symptoms of the diseases through its indirect anticholinergic effects. Assessing baseline renal function helps to make sure that the kidneys may sufficiently clear the medication through excretion. The liver function needs to be normal to sufficiently metabolize the drug. Grapefruit does not cause a proarrhythmic condition as seen when clients take amiodarone or calcium channel blockers. It is not a food contraindication for quinidine.
