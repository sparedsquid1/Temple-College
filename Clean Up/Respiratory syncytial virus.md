  - RSV

[[Respiratory]] syncytial virus (RSV) is a common and highly contagious virus that infects the [[Respiratory]] tract. It is a leading cause of [[Respiratory]] infections, particularly in infants and young children, but it can also affect older adults and people with weakened immune systems.

### Transmission:
- **Direct contact:** RSV is spread through direct contact with [[Respiratory]] secretions from an infected person, such as through touching, kissing, or shaking hands.
- **Aerosol droplets:** The virus can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets into the air that others can inhale.
- **Surfaces:** RSV can survive on surfaces like doorknobs, toys, and countertops for several hours, and people can become infected by touching these surfaces and then touching their face.

### Symptoms:
- **In infants and young children:**
  - **Runny nose**
  - **Coughing**
  - **Wheezing**
  - **[[Fever]]**
  - **Difficulty breathing**
  - **Irritability**
  - **Decreased appetite**
  - **Apnea:** In very young infants, RSV can cause pauses in breathing (apnea).

- **In older children and adults:**
  - **Cold-like symptoms:** Such as a runny nose, cough, and mild [[Fever]].
  - **Wheezing:** Particularly in those with asthma or other lung conditions.
  - **Fatigue**
  - **Sore throat**

### Complications:
- **Bronchiolitis:** Inflammation of the small airways in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing.
- **Pneumonia:** Infection of the lungs that can be severe, especially in infants, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems.
- **Asthma exacerbation:** In children and adults with asthma, RSV can trigger severe asthma attacks.
- **Hospitalization:** Severe cases, especially in infants, may require hospitalization for supportive care, including oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.

### High-Risk Groups:
- **Infants, especially those under 6 months old.**
- **Premature babies.**
- **Children with congenital [[Heart]] disease or chronic lung disease.**
- **Immunocompromised individuals.**
- **Older adults, particularly those with chronic [[Heart]] or lung diseases.**

### Diagnosis:
- **Physical examination:** A healthcare provider may diagnose RSV based on symptoms and a physical exam, particularly during RSV season.
- **[[Lab]] tests:** Nasal swab tests can detect RSV by identifying the virus or its genetic material.
- **Chest X-rays:** In severe cases, an X-ray might be used to check for pneumonia or bronchiolitis.

### Treatment:
There is no specific antiviral treatment for RSV, so care is mainly supportive:

- **Hydration:** Ensuring that the patient stays well-hydrated is crucial, especially if they are feeding less due to difficulty breathing.
- **Oxygen therapy:** May be needed for those with severe [[Respiratory]] distress.
- **Mechanical ventilation:** In severe cases where breathing is significantly impaired.
- **Medications:** While antibiotics are not effective against RSV, they might be used if a bacterial infection develops as a complication. [[Bronchodilators]] or [[Corticosteroids]] might be prescribed in some cases, although their routine use is not always recommended.

### Prevention:
- **Good hygiene:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and cleaning surfaces can help reduce the spread of RSV.
- **Avoiding exposure:** Keeping young infants away from crowded places, especially during RSV season, can reduce the risk of infection.
- **Palivizumab:** This is a monoclonal antibody that can be given to high-risk infants, such as those born prematurely or with certain [[Heart]] or lung conditions, to help prevent severe RSV disease.

### Prognosis:
- **Infants and children:** Most children recover from RSV within 1 to 2 weeks, though some may have lingering wheezing or coughing for a few weeks.
- **Adults:** For most healthy adults, RSV causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, in older adults or those with chronic health conditions, it can lead to more severe [[Respiratory]] illness.
- **High-risk individuals:** In those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions, RSV can cause severe complications and may require hospitalization.
