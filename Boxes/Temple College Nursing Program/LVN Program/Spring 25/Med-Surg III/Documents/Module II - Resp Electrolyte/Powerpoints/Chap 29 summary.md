# Chapter 29: Respiratory System Function, Data Collection, and Therapeutic Measures

## Summary

### Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory System
- The [[Respiratory]] system includes the **nose, pharynx, [[Larynx]], [[trachea]], [[bronchi]], and lungs**.
- Gas exchange occurs in the **alveoli**, where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is expelled.
- **Acid-base balance** is regulated through breathing:
  - **[[Respiratory]] acidosis**: Caused by **hypoventilation**, leading to CO₂ retention.
  - **[[Respiratory]] alkalosis**: Caused by **hyperventilation**, leading to excessive CO₂ elimination.

### Effects of Aging on the Respiratory System
- **Decreased elasticity** in lung tissues
- **Reduced ciliary activity**, increasing infection risk
- **Decreased cough reflex** and weaker [[Respiratory]] muscles

### Data Collection for Respiratory Disorders
- **Health history**: Includes **upper/lower [[Respiratory]] symptoms**, smoking history, family history, and treatments.
- **Physical assessment**:
  - **Inspection**: Symmetry, **use of accessory muscles**, color, [[Respiratory]] rate/rhythm
  - **Palpation**: Sinuses, **crepitus**, [[Respiratory]] excursion
  - **Percussion**: Resonance, **hyper-resonance**, dullness
  - **Auscultation**: Normal and **adventitious breath sounds** (crackles, wheezes, stridor, friction rub, diminished/absent sounds)

### Diagnostic Tests
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ABGs, **D-dimer, cultures, oxygen saturation, capnography**
- **Imaging**: Chest **X-ray, CT scan, V/Q scan**
- **Other tests**: Pulmonary function tests, **bronchoscopy, pulmonary angiography**

### Smoking Cessation
- **Behavior modification, counseling, nicotine replacement, drug therapy, hypnosis, physical activity**

### Therapeutic Measures
- **Breathing exercises**: Diaphragmatic, **pursed-lip breathing**
- **Coughing techniques**: Huff coughing, autogenic drainage
- **Oxygen therapy**: Nasal cannula, **oxygen masks, transtracheal catheter**
- **Incentive spirometry**
- **Chest physiotherapy**
- **Mechanical ventilation**: Invasive vs. **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV)**
- **Tracheostomy care**
