Thyrotoxicosis is a medical condition characterized by an excessive amount of thyroid [[Hormones]] in the bloodstream. This can lead to an accelerated metabolism and a range of symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, weight loss, nervousness, irritability, increased sweating, and tremors. 

Thyrotoxicosis is often associated with conditions like **[[Graves' disease]]**, **[[toxic multinodular goiter]]**, or **thyroiditis**, which cause the thyroid gland to become overactive (a condition known as hyperthyroidism). However, thyrotoxicosis can also result from taking too much thyroid hormone medication. 

Proper diagnosis and treatment are important to manage the symptoms and underlying causes of thyrotoxicosis.
