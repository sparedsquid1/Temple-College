Pyridoxine deficiency, also known as vitamin B6 deficiency, occurs when there is an insufficient amount of pyridoxine in the body. Pyridoxine is essential for numerous physiological functions, including amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, hemoglobin production, and the maintenance of normal homocysteine levels.

### Symptoms:
- **Dermatological Issues:**
  - Seborrheic dermatitis (especially around the eyes, nose, and [[Mouth]])
  - Cheilosis (cracks at the corners of the [[Mouth]])
- **Neurological Symptoms:**
  - Irritability
  - [[Depression]]
  - Confusion
  - Neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling or numbness)
  - Seizures (particularly in severe cases)
- **Hematological Symptoms:**
  - Microcytic anemia (small red [[Blood]] cells)
- **Other Symptoms:**
  - Weakness
  - Fatigue
  - [[glossitis]] (swollen, sore [[Tongue]])

### Causes:
- **Inadequate Dietary Intake:**
  - Poor diet lacking in vitamin B6-rich foods
- **Malabsorption Syndromes:**
  - Conditions like celiac disease or Crohn's disease that impair nutrient absorption
- **Certain Medications:**
  - [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] like [[isoniazid]], penicillamine, and some [[Anticonvulsants]] can interfere with vitamin B6 metabolism
- **Alcoholism:**
  - Can lead to poor dietary intake and impaired absorption of pyridoxine

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Blood]] Tests:**
  - Measuring serum levels of pyridoxine or its active form, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)
- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:**
  - Based on symptoms and dietary history

### Treatment:
- **Dietary Supplementation:**
  - Pyridoxine supplements (oral or intramuscular injections, depending on severity)
- **Dietary Changes:**
  - Increasing intake of B6-rich foods (e.g., poultry, fish, potatoes, chickpeas, bananas, fortified cereals)

### Prognosis:
- **With timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment, symptoms generally improve, and deficiency can be corrected.**
