### **Summary of Chapter 47: Neurological System Function, Data Collection, and Therapeutic Measures**

This chapter provides an overview of the neurological system, including its structure, function, assessment, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic interventions. The key topics covered include:

#### **1. Neurological System Overview**

- **Structure & Function**: Neurons, brain, spinal cord, reflex arcs, and cranial nerves.
- **Autonomic Nervous System**: Sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) responses.
- **Effects of Aging**: Decreased reflexes, memory changes, and slower nerve conduction.

#### **2. Neurological Assessment**

- **Basic Neurological Exam**: Level of consciousness, vital signs, pupil response, muscle strength, and sensation.
- **History Collection**: Symptoms, medication history, surgical history, lifestyle, and family history.
- **Physical Examination**: Mental state, pupillary response, muscle function, and cranial nerve assessment.
- **Assessment Scales**:
    - **Glasgow Coma Scale**: Evaluates eye, verbal, and motor responses.
    - **FOUR Score Coma Scale**: Used for unconscious patients.
    - **BE FAST Stroke Assessment**: Balance, Eyes, Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to act.

#### **3. Diagnostic Tests**

- **Laboratory Tests**: Thyroid levels, vitamin B12, CBC, electrolytes, liver/renal function tests.
- **Lumbar Puncture**: Procedure for CSF analysis, requiring flat bedrest post-procedure.
- **Imaging Studies**:
    - **CT Scan**: May require contrast; assess allergies.
    - **MRI**: Contraindicated in patients with pacemakers/metal implants.
    - **Angiogram**: Checks blood vessels; requires bedrest and pressure on the catheter site post-procedure.
    - **Myelogram**: Uses contrast dye to evaluate the spinal cord; requires elevated head positioning post-test.
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: Evaluates brain activity; requires clean, dry hair before the test.

#### **4. Therapeutic Measures**

- **Mobility & Positioning**: Preventing contractures, promoting early mobilization.
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)**: Encouraging patient independence while providing necessary support.
- **Communication Strategies**:
    - **Dysarthria**: Difficulty speaking due to muscle control issues.
    - **Aphasia**: Impairment in expressing (expressive) or understanding (receptive) language.
    - **Interventions**: Using gestures, communication boards, and patience.
- **Nutrition Support**: Addressing swallowing difficulties with thickened liquids and upright positioning.
- **ISBARR Communication**: Standardized approach for reporting patient concerns to physicians.

# **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

#### **1. The nurse is assessing a patient with a neurological disorder. The patient’s pupils remain at 3 mm and do not react to light. Which cranial nerve may be affected?**

1. Optic (CN II)
2. Oculomotor (CN III)
3. Abducens (CN VI)
4. Facial (CN VII)

**Correct Answer: 2 (Oculomotor)**

- **Rationale**: The oculomotor nerve controls pupil constriction. Non-reactive pupils suggest possible cranial nerve III impairment.

#### **2. Which of the following is a primary function of the vagus nerve (CN X)?**

1. Eye movement
2. Control of heart rate and digestion
3. Shoulder elevation
4. Facial sensation

**Correct Answer: 2 (Control of heart rate and digestion)**

3. Cranial nerve function
4. Coma depth

**Correct Answer: 4 (Coma depth)**

- **Rationale**: The FOUR Score is a neurological assessment tool used for patients in a coma.

#### **5. Which of the following is a parasympathetic nervous system response? (Select all that apply)**

1. Increased heart rate
2. Pupil constriction
3. Increased digestion
4. Relaxed urinary bladder
5. Dry mouth

**Correct Answers: 2 & 3 (Pupil constriction, Increased digestion)**

- **Rationale**: The parasympathetic system promotes "rest and digest" functions, including digestion and pupil constriction.

#### **6. Which nursing intervention is most important for a stroke patient with dysphagia?**

1. Encourage independent eating
2. Offer liquids with a straw
3. Position upright during meals
4. Provide soft foods only

**Correct Answer: 3 (Position upright during meals)**

- **Rationale**: Sitting upright reduces the risk of aspiration in patients with swallowing difficulties.

#### **7. A patient undergoing a lumbar puncture should remain in what position post-procedure?**

1. Supine for 6-8 hours
2. Semi-Fowler’s
3. Prone
4. High Fowler’s

**Correct Answer: 1 (Supine for 6-8 hours)**

- **Rationale**: Lying flat prevents cerebrospinal fluid leakage and reduces headache risk.

#### **8. What is the priority nursing action for a patient post-angiogram?**

1. Encourage ambulation
2. Check pulses and insertion site
3. Administer pain medication
4. Offer a full liquid diet

**Correct Answer: 2 (Check pulses and insertion site)**

- **Rationale**: Monitoring for bleeding and circulation impairment at the catheter insertion site is critical.

#### **9. What is the purpose of an EEG?**

1. To measure muscle response
2. To assess electrical activity in the brain
3. To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid
4. To detect blood flow in the brain

**Correct Answer: 2 (To assess electrical activity in the brain)**

- **Rationale**: EEGs evaluate brain function and help diagnose seizure disorders.

#### **10. The nurse is preparing a patient for an MRI. What is the priority assessment?**

1. Checking for allergies
2. Ensuring the patient has an empty bladder
3. Screening for metal implants
4. Encouraging deep breathing
