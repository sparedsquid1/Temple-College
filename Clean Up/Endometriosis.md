Endometriosis is a chronic medical condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the [[uterus]] (the endometrium) grows outside the [[uterus]], often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis. In rare cases, it can also be found in other parts of the body.

### How Endometriosis Works:
- **Ectopic Growth:** The endometrial-like tissue that grows outside the [[uterus]] behaves like the endometrial tissue inside the [[uterus]]â€”it thickens, breaks down, and bleeds with each menstrual cycle.
- **Trapped [[Blood]]:** Unlike the normal endometrial tissue that sheds and exits the body during menstruation, this [[Blood]] has no way to leave the body, leading to inflammation, scar tissue (adhesions), and sometimes cysts known as endometriomas, typically found on the ovaries.

### Symptoms:
- **Pelvic Pain:** Often severe, especially during menstruation. This is the most common symptom of endometriosis.
- **Painful Periods ([[dysmenorrhea]]):** Pain before and during menstruation.
- **Pain During Intercourse:** Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis.
- **Pain with Bowel Movements or Urination:** Particularly during menstrual periods.
- **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding:** Some women experience heavy periods or bleeding between periods.
- **[[infertility]]:** Endometriosis is sometimes first diagnosed in those seeking treatment for [[infertility]].
- **Fatigue, Diarrhea, Constipation, Bloating, and Nausea:** Particularly during menstrual periods.

### Causes:
The exact cause of endometriosis is not well understood, but several theories exist, including:
- **Retrograde Menstruation:** Where menstrual [[Blood]] flows backward through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity instead of leaving the body.
- **Embryonic Cell Transformation:** [[Hormones]] such as [[estrogen]] may transform embryonic cells into endometrial-like cell implants during puberty.
- **Surgical Scars:** After surgeries like hysterectomy or C-section, endometrial cells may attach to the surgical incision.
- **Immune System Disorders:** Problems with the immune system might make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometrial-like tissue growing outside the [[uterus]].

### Diagnosis:
Endometriosis can be challenging to diagnose. Methods include:
- **Pelvic Exam:** A doctor may feel for large cysts or scars behind the [[uterus]].
- **Imaging Tests:** [[ultrasound]] or MRI can help identify cysts associated with endometriosis.
- **Laparoscopy:** The definitive way to diagnose endometriosis. A surgeon makes a small incision in the abdomen and uses a laparoscope to view the pelvic organs. Tissue samples can also be taken for biopsy.

### Treatment:
Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms and whether the patient wishes to become pregnant. They include:
- **Pain Medications:** [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]] like [[ibuprofen]] to relieve pain.
- **Hormonal Therapy:** Birth control pills, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists, and antagonists, or progestin therapy to reduce or eliminate menstruation.
- **Surgical Treatment:** Laparoscopic surgery to remove as much endometriosis as possible while preserving fertility. In severe cases, a hysterectomy (removal of the [[uterus]]) may be recommended.
- **Lifestyle Changes:** Regular exercise, heat application, and relaxation techniques to manage pain and improve quality of life.

Endometriosis is a chronic condition that can significantly impact quality of life, but with proper management, many women can find relief from symptoms.
