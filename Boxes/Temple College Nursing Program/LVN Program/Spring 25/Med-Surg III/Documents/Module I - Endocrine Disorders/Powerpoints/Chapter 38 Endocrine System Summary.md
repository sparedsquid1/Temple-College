* **Thyroid gland**: produces thyroid [[Hormones]] (T3 and T4) that regulate metabolism
* **Parathyroid glands**: produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) that regulates calcium levels in the [[Blood]]
* **Adrenal glands**: produce [[cortisol]] (stress hormone), aldosterone (regulates sodium and potassium levels), and other [[Hormones]]
* **[[Pancreas]]**: produces insulin (regulates glucose levels) and [[glucagon]] (raises glucose levels)
* **Ovaries/[[testes]]**: produce sex [[Hormones]] ([[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[testosterone]])

## Effects of Aging on the Endocrine System

As people age, their [[Endocrine System]] undergoes changes that can affect hormone production. These changes can lead to various health issues, such as:

* Decreased thyroid function
* Decreased adrenal function
* Decreased insulin sensitivity (leading to diabetes)
* Osteoporosis (due to decreased bone density)

## Nursing Assessment and Physical Examination

When assessing a patient with an endocrine disorder, the nurse should:

* Obtain a detailed health history, including:
	+ Neuromuscular symptoms
	+ Weight changes
	+ Excessive thirst or urination
	+ Heat or cold tolerance
	+ Mood and memory changes
	+ Family history of endocrine disorders
* Perform a physical examination, including:
	+ Vital signs (temperature, pulse, [[Blood]] pressure)
	+ Weight
	+ Skin changes (e.g., dry skin, thinning skin)
	+ Tremor
	+ Affect (mood)
	+ Exophthalmos (protruding eyeballs)
	+ Fat pads (e.g., buffalo hump)

## Common Laboratory Tests for Endocrine Disorders

The following laboratory tests are commonly used to diagnose and monitor endocrine disorders:

* **Thyroid tests**:
	+ Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
	+ Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)
* **Parathyroid tests**:
	+ Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
	+ Calcium
	+ Phosphorus
* **Pituitary tests**:
	+ [[Growth Hormone]] (GH)
	+ Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
	+ Urine specific gravity
	+ Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
* **Adrenal tests**:
	+ [[cortisol]]
	+ 24-hour urine for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)
