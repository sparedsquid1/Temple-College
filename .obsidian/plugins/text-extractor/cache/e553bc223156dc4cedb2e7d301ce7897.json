Right Left Right Right Left Left Lead II is used most. As cardiac electric activity is occurring, the ECG is viewing and recording it. The different Lead placements, provide different \"camera views\" of what the lead is viewing. As cardiac electric activity is occurring, the ECG is viewing and recording it.

Call a code and start CPR. Expect defibrillation to occur.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
