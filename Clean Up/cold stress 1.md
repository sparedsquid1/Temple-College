Cold stress in premature babies occurs when their body temperature drops too low, which is common due to their underdeveloped ability to regulate body heat. This can lead to increased energy use, rapid breathing, and other complications. If untreated, it can impair vital functions like circulation and organ performance. Managing cold stress involves ensuring the baby stays warm through controlled environments, appropriate clothing, and skin-to-skin contact with caregivers.
