Extravasation refers to the accidental leakage of a drug or fluid from a vein into the surrounding tissue during intravenous (IV) administration. This can occur when the needle or catheter is not properly positioned within the vein or if the vein becomes damaged or leaks. Extravasation can lead to local tissue damage, particularly if the fluid is an irritant or vesicant (a substance that can cause blistering and tissue necrosis).

### Key Points About Extravasation:
- **Causes:** 
  - Incorrect needle or catheter placement.
  - Fragile or damaged veins.
  - High pressure during infusion, such as when using a pump.
  - Use of certain medications that are prone to causing tissue damage if they leak out of the vein.

- **Symptoms:**
  - Pain, burning, or stinging at the injection site.
  - Swelling, redness, or warmth around the IV site.
  - Blistering or ulceration in severe cases.
  - Tightness or firmness in the affected area.

- **Medications Commonly Associated with Extravasation:**
  - Chemotherapy [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] (e.g., [[doxorubicin]], [[vincristine]]).
  - Certain antibiotics (e.g., [[vancomycin]]).
  - Hypertonic solutions (e.g., concentrated potassium chloride, calcium).
  - Vasopressors (e.g., [[Dopamine]], norepinephrine).

### Management of Extravasation:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Stop the infusion immediately if extravasation is suspected.
   - Do not remove the IV catheter or needle right away; try to aspirate any remaining drug from the catheter.
   - Mark the affected area to monitor for changes over time.

2. **Interventions:**
   - Elevate the affected limb to reduce swelling.
   - Apply a cold or warm compress, depending on the type of drug involved. For example, cold compresses are often used for most [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], but heat is recommended for vinca alkaloids and other agents where dispersion is desirable.
   - Administer antidotes if available and appropriate. For example, hyaluronidase can be used to disperse certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may be applied topically for specific chemotherapeutic agents.

3. **Follow-Up Care:**
   - Monitor the site closely for signs of worsening injury.
   - Depending on the severity, surgical consultation may be needed, particularly if tissue necrosis or severe ulceration develops.
   - Pain management and wound care may be necessary, especially in severe cases.

### Prevention:
- **Proper IV Placement:** Ensuring correct and stable placement of the IV catheter.
- **Use of Central Venous Access:** For vesicant [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] or long-term therapy, central venous access devices (e.g., PICC lines or central lines) may reduce the risk of extravasation.
- **Slow Infusion Rates:** Administering high-risk [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] slowly to reduce the pressure on the vein.
- **Frequent Monitoring:** Regularly checking the IV site for signs of extravasation, especially when administering high-risk medications.

Extravasation is a medical emergency, and timely intervention is crucial to minimize tissue damage and long-term complications. Proper training for healthcare providers and patient education about the signs and symptoms can help reduce the incidence and severity of extravasation events.
