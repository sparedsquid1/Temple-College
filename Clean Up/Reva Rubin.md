Reva Rubin was a prominent nurse and researcher who made significant contributions to maternal and child health, particularly in the field of postpartum care. She is best known for her work on the psychological and emotional aspects of motherhood, emphasizing the importance of the mother's emotional well-being during the postpartum period.

Rubin introduced a framework that highlighted the phases of maternal role attainment. Her [[theory]] suggested that women go through three stages during the postpartum period:

1. **Taking-in phase**: This occurs immediately after childbirth, when the mother is primarily focused on her own needs and recovery. During this time, she may rely on others to care for her baby while she processes the experience of labor and delivery.
   
2. **Taking-hold phase**: In this phase, the mother begins to take more responsibility for the care of her baby, gaining confidence in her ability to meet her child's needs. This stage often includes a learning curve as the mother adapts to her new role.

3. **Letting-go phase**: This phase involves the mother adjusting to her new [[identity]] as a mother while integrating her previous roles and responsibilities. It may include accepting the reality of her baby and the changes that motherhood brings.

Rubin's work was pioneering in recognizing the emotional and psychological transitions that mothers undergo, emphasizing the need for healthcare professionals to support not just the physical recovery but also the emotional and psychological well-being of new mothers.
