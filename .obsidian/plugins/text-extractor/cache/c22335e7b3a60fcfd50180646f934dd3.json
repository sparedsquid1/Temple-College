Rationalization was an early favorite of mine that I used poorly from childhood through early adulthood contributing to the demise of my first marriage. Denial was one that I skipped and progressed straight to repression. I felt very lonely at certain points of my childhood and adolescence and to cope with that isolation I unknowingly built walls to allow some disconnect from others and not allowing myself to understand quite why or how I felt about non-family members. My current mechanism of choice is compensation. Leaving behind a lucrative career to start all over again for altruistic reasons and a compulsive desire to learn everything I can about the conditions my wife and I will be facing as we continue to age feels like I’m using the altruism and learning as compensation for the loss of financial security.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
