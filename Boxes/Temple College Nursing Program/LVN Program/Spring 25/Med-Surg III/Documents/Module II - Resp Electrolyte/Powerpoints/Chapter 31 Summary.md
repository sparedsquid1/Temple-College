### **Summary of Chapter 31: Nursing Care of Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Disorders**

- Understand the pathophysiology, etiology, signs, and symptoms of lower [[Respiratory]] disorders.
- Identify diagnostic tests for these disorders.
- Explain therapeutic interventions and nursing care plans.
- Recognize interventions for impaired gas exchange, ineffective airway clearance, and ineffective breathing patterns.

### **Lower Respiratory Tract Disorders and Their Management**

#### **Bronchiectasis**

- **Pathophysiology:** Chronic infection leads to dilation of bronchi, causing airway obstruction.
- **Causes:** Secondary to cystic fibrosis, asthma, TB.
- **Symptoms:** Dyspnea, cough, large amounts of sputum, clubbing, crackles/wheezes.
- **Diagnosis:** X-ray, CT scan, sputum culture.
- **Treatment:** Antibiotics, mucolytics, bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, oxygen therapy, surgery.

#### **Pneumonia**

- **Pathophysiology:** Acute lung infection causes inflammation, alveolar damage, and exudate formation.
- **Causes:** Bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae), virus, fungus, aspiration, ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP), chemical exposure.
- **Risk Factors:** Young, elderly, hospitalized, intubated, immunocompromised.
- **Prevention:** Vaccination(Flu & Pneumonia), deep breathing, hand washing, mouth care.
- **Symptoms:** Chest pain, fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, sputum production, crackles, malaise.
- **Complications:** Pleurisy, pleural effusion, atelectasis, systemic infection.
- **Diagnosis:** Chest X-ray, sputum culture, blood cultures.
- **Treatment:** Antibiotics, antivirals, bronchodilators, expectorants, oxygen, fluids.

#### **Tuberculosis (TB)**

- **Pathophysiology:** Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects lungs; tubercles form and may become active with weakened immunity.
- **Risk Factors:** Elderly, alcoholics, crowded living conditions, new immigrants, HIV-positive individuals.
- **Symptoms:** Chronic cough, blood-tinged sputum, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, low-grade fever, dyspnea, chest pain (late stage).
- **Diagnosis:** PPD skin test, chest X-ray, sputum cultures, QuantiFERON-TB/T-SPOT tests.
- **Treatment:** Combination drug therapy for 6-24 months (Isoniazid, Rifampin, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide), isolation precautions.

#### **Restrictive Lung Disorders**

- **Pleurisy:** Inflammation of pleura causing sharp pain, shallow breathing, fever, friction rub.
- **Pleural Effusion:** Fluid buildup in pleural space causing dyspnea, tachypnea, diminished breath sounds. Diagnosed via X-ray, treated with thoracentesis.
- **Pulmonary Fibrosis:** Scarred lung tissue reduces gas exchange, leading to progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, clubbing of fingers.
- **Atelectasis:** Alveolar collapse due to hypoventilation; treated with deep breathing, coughing, incentive spirometry.

#### **Obstructive Lung Disorders**

- **COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**
    
    - **Chronic Bronchitis:** Excess mucus, cough, wheezing, thick sputum.
    - **Emphysema:** Alveolar destruction causes air trapping, dyspnea, barrel chest.
    - **Risk Factors:** Smoking, pollutants, genetics.
    - **Complications:** Respiratory failure, cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure).
    - **Treatment:** Smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, pulmonary rehab.
- **Asthma**
    
    - **Pathophysiology:** Reversible airway inflammation and bronchospasm.
    - **Triggers:** Allergens, pollution, smoking, infections, stress.
    - **Symptoms:** Dyspnea, wheezing, cough, accessory muscle use.
    - **Complication:** Status asthmaticus (severe asthma attack, life-threatening).
    - **Treatment:** Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, peak flow monitoring, trigger avoidance.
- **Cystic Fibrosis**
    
    - **Pathophysiology:** Hereditary exocrine disorder causing thick mucus in lungs and digestive system.
    - **Symptoms:** Frequent infections, thick sputum, clubbing, malabsorption, fatty stools.
    - **Treatment:** Hydration, mucolytics, antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes, lung transplant.

#### **Other Respiratory Conditions**

- **Pulmonary Embolism:** Blood clot in the lung causing sudden dyspnea, tachycardia, hemoptysis; treated with anticoagulants, thrombolytics.
- **Pneumothorax:** Air in pleural space collapses lung; treated with chest tube placement.
- **Acute Respiratory Failure:** Hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis and confusion; requires oxygen, mechanical ventilation.
- **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** Lung damage from sepsis or trauma causes pulmonary edema and alveolar collapse, leading to high mortality.
- **Lung Cancer:** Mostly caused by smoking; presents with persistent cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, diagnosed via biopsy, treated with chemo, radiation, surgery.
