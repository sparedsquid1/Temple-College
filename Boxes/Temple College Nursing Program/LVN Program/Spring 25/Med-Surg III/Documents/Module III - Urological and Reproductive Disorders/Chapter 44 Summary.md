### **5. Prevention and Nursing Considerations**

- **Safer sex practices:** Condoms, regular STI testing, vaccination (HPV, Hepatitis B).
- **Patient education:** Importance of completing antibiotics, avoiding reinfection, and notifying partners.
- **Newborn considerations:** **Chlamydia and gonorrhea require prophylactic eye drops** to prevent blindness.
- **Mandatory reporting:** Certain STIs must be reported to public health authorities.

## **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

### **1. Which STI is known to cause a painless chancre in its primary stage?**

a) Gonorrhea  
b) Herpes simplex  
c) Syphilis  
d) Trichomoniasis

**Answer:** **c) Syphilis**  
**Rationale:** The primary stage of syphilis presents as a painless sore (chancre), which heals on its own but requires treatment to prevent progression.

---

### **2. A patient is diagnosed with gonorrhea. What medication is typically prescribed?**

a) Acyclovir  
b) Ceftriaxone  
c) Metronidazole  
d) Penicillin

**Answer:** **b) Ceftriaxone**  
**Rationale:** Ceftriaxone is the recommended treatment for gonorrhea, often combined with azithromycin.

---

### **3. Which STI is associated with a "strawberry cervix"?**

a) HPV  
b) Trichomoniasis  
c) Chlamydia  
d) Syphilis

**Answer:** **b) Trichomoniasis**  
**Rationale:** Trichomoniasis can cause a "strawberry" appearance on the cervix due to inflammation.

---

### **4. What is the primary method to prevent HPV-related cancers?**

a) Routine Pap smears  
b) HPV vaccination  
c) Antibiotic therapy  
d) Frequent douching

**Answer:** **b) HPV vaccination**  
**Rationale:** The HPV vaccine (Gardasil) helps prevent high-risk HPV strains that cause cervical cancer.

---

### **5. Which STI requires newborns to receive prophylactic eye drops?**

a) Trichomoniasis  
b) Gonorrhea  
c) Syphilis  
d) HPV

**Answer:** **b) Gonorrhea**  
**Rationale:** Newborns receive eye drops to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum, a serious eye infection caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia.

---
### **6. A patient with syphilis is in the secondary stage. What symptom should the nurse expect?**

a) Genital ulcers  
b) Flu-like symptoms and a rash  
c) Painful urination  
d) Vesicular lesions

**Answer:** **b) Flu-like symptoms and a rash**  
**Rationale:** Secondary syphilis presents with flu-like symptoms, a widespread rash, and condylomata lata (wart-like growths).

---

### **7. Which STI is most commonly reported in the United States?**

a) Syphilis  
b) Gonorrhea  
c) Chlamydia  
d) Herpes simplex

**Answer:** **c) Chlamydia**  
**Rationale:** Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial STI in the U.S. and is often asymptomatic.

---

### **8. What is the best method to prevent the transmission of STIs?**

a) Use of spermicides  
b) Practicing abstinence  
c) Avoiding multiple sexual partners  
d) Getting routine Pap smears

**Answer:** **b) Practicing abstinence**  
**Rationale:** Abstinence is the most effective way to prevent STI transmission. However, condoms and regular STI screening also reduce risks.

---

### **9. A patient with genital herpes asks if the infection can be cured. What is the best response?**

a) "Yes, with a full course of antiviral medications."  
b) "No, but medications can help manage outbreaks."  
c) "No, but you will only have one outbreak in your lifetime."  
d) "Yes, as long as you avoid sexual contact."

**Answer:** **b) "No, but medications can help manage outbreaks."**  
**Rationale:** Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a lifelong infection, but antiviral drugs (e.g., acyclovir) can reduce the severity and frequency of outbreaks.

---

### **10. A woman diagnosed with trichomoniasis is prescribed metronidazole (Flagyl). What should the nurse include in teaching?**

a) "Avoid alcohol while taking this medication."  
b) "Take the medication on an empty stomach."  
c) "Stop the medication once symptoms improve."  
d) "Increase dairy intake while on treatment."

**Answer:** **a) "Avoid alcohol while taking this medication."**  
**Rationale:** Metronidazole interacts with alcohol, causing severe nausea and vomiting. Patients should avoid alcohol during and for 48 hours after treatment.

---

### **11. What is the primary risk of untreated chlamydia in women?**

a) Liver failure  
b) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  
c) Genital warts  
d) Syphilis

**Answer:** **b) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**  
**Rationale:** Untreated chlamydia can ascend into the reproductive tract, causing PID, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

---

### **12. A nurse is teaching a patient about the Gardasil vaccine. Which statement indicates understanding?**

a) "This vaccine will cure HPV infections."  
b) "Gardasil protects against all types of HPV."  
c) "The vaccine helps prevent cervical cancer."  
d) "Only women should receive the HPV vaccine."

**Answer:** **c) "The vaccine helps prevent cervical cancer."**  
**Rationale:** The HPV vaccine protects against high-risk HPV strains that can cause cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers.

---

### **13. A newborn exposed to gonorrhea is at risk for what complication?**

a) Congenital heart defects  
b) Blindness (ophthalmia neonatorum)  
c) Neural tube defects  
d) Respiratory distress

**Answer:** **b) Blindness (ophthalmia neonatorum)**  
**Rationale:** Gonorrhea can cause severe eye infections in newborns, leading to blindness. Newborns receive antibiotic eye drops at birth.

---

### **14. What symptom is most characteristic of primary syphilis?**

a) Painless chancre  
b) Burning urination  
c) Thick, foul-smelling vaginal discharge  
d) Flu-like symptoms

**Answer:** **a) Painless chancre**  
**Rationale:** A painless ulcer (chancre) is the hallmark of primary syphilis and appears at the site of infection.

---

### **15. A patient with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is taking valacyclovir. What should the nurse teach?**

a) "This medication will cure your infection."  
b) "Avoid sexual contact during an active outbreak."  
c) "Stop the medication when lesions disappear."  
d) "Take this medication only when you feel symptoms."

**Answer:** **b) "Avoid sexual contact during an active outbreak."**  
**Rationale:** HSV is highly contagious during outbreaks. Antiviral therapy can reduce symptoms but does not cure the infection.

---

### **16. A nurse is counseling a patient about STI prevention. Which statement indicates the need for further teaching?**

a) "Condoms reduce my risk of getting an STI."  
b) "Douching after sex will help prevent infection."  
c) "Getting vaccinated for HPV can protect me from some cancers."  
d) "Having multiple partners increases my risk of infection."

**Answer:** **b) "Douching after sex will help prevent infection."**  
**Rationale:** Douching can disrupt normal vaginal flora and increase STI risk. It is not recommended.

---

### **17. Which STI is characterized by painful genital ulcers?**

a) Gonorrhea  
b) Herpes simplex virus  
c) HPV  
d) Chlamydia

**Answer:** **b) Herpes simplex virus**  
**Rationale:** HSV causes painful vesicles that develop into ulcers, especially during an outbreak.

---

### **18. Which patient statement suggests a need for further STI education?**

a) "I should complete my antibiotics even if I feel better."  
b) "I should notify my partner if I have an STI."  
c) "Birth control pills will protect me from STIs."  
d) "I should get tested regularly if I have multiple partners."

**Answer:** **c) "Birth control pills will protect me from STIs."**  
**Rationale:** Birth control pills prevent pregnancy but do not protect against STIs.

---

### **19. A patient asks how to protect against hepatitis B. What should the nurse recommend?**

a) "Avoid sharing personal hygiene items."  
b) "Use birth control pills."  
c) "Take antibiotics before sexual activity."  
d) "Avoid drinking alcohol."

**Answer:** **a) "Avoid sharing personal hygiene items."**  
**Rationale:** Hepatitis B spreads through blood and bodily fluids. Avoiding shared razors, toothbrushes, and needles helps prevent infection.

---

### **20. A pregnant woman with genital herpes asks about delivery options. What is the best response?**

a) "You must have a C-section to prevent infection."  
b) "You can deliver vaginally if you have no active lesions."  
c) "Your baby will not be affected, regardless of delivery method."
