deaconess ▪ Caring for the sick became a function of religious orders o Florence Nightingale: important to see patients holistically during Crimean war ▪ Nutrition is essential for proper healing ▪ Fresh, clean air benefits the sick ▪ OT and PT ▪ Meet personal needs: include emotional support ▪ Directed by 2 conditions: health and illness ▪ Nursing separate from medicine: nurses should be taught by nurses ▪ Importance of continuing education ▪ Improved sanitation of wards and lowered death rates from 60% to 1% o Dorothea Dix: reformed mental health ▪ Importance of not treating mentally ill like animals o Clara Barton: the red cross; cared for both armies during the civil war ▪ Importance of caring for people with different beliefs o Lillian Wald & Mary Brewster: Henry Street Settlement services ▪ Made sure people had means to live day to day o Differences between England & U.S schools of nursing ▪ England: trained by nurses ▪ U.S.: trained by physicians o Roles of practical nurse: ▪ Caregiving, educator, collaborator, advocate, & manager by making sure the care is patient-centered ❖ Standards of nursing practice & desirable behaviors that support it o American Nurses Association (ANA): standards of nursing practice & the code of ethics; these standards protect the nurse, patient and the health care agency. o Texas Board of Nursing: nursing practice act, based on Texas legislation, & protects the public while defining legal scopes of practice ❖ Quality of safety & evidence-based practice & influence on safe practices o Quality of safety is based on evidence-based practice ❖ Compare methods of delivery of nursing care o Nursing care: delivered safely and based on knowledge o Functional nursing: task oriented; cannot see patient as a whole ▪ Distribution of tasks, target of action (the task at hand, not the patient), may lack coordination, economically efficient o Team nursing: nurses are divided into teams with charge nurse as the leader ▪ Patients feel secure & nurses demonstrate teamwork ▪ Disadvantages: can turn into functional nursing; patients cannot identify their primary nurse o Total patient care: single nurse has full responsibility of a patient ▪ Advantages: individualized and promotes nurse-patient relationship ▪ Disadvantages: requires more staff o Primary nursing: what we want because it provides the best quality care ▪ Patients can identify their primary nurse, delegation to associate nurses when primary nurse is busy, reduces number errors, encourages nurse to patient relationship, provides autonomy for nurse ❖ Ways nurse advocates for improving health care rights of patients & families through: o Self-determination: o Right of refusal: o Legal factors: ❖ Health Maintenance Organization (HMO): in network that provides limited network of physicians, hospitals, and health care providers; cheaper o One goal is to keep patients healthy and out of hospital ❖ Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): preforms services at a set cost that can be from a larger range of providers; more expensive Ch 2: Concepts of Health, Illness, Stress, & Health Promotion (Williams) ❖ Compare traditional & current views of health & illness o Health: state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity o Chronic illness: develops slowly over long period and lasts throughout life (hypertension & T2D) o Acute illness: rapid and sudden; usually resolves in a short time (influenza or appendicitis) o Terminal illness: no cure available; ends in death (cancer) o Primary illness: no cause; patient only has one major problem o Secondary illness: results from primary illness (diabetes can lead to necrosis; influenza can lead to pneumonia) o Congenital: based on genetics; present at birth o Stages of illness: ▪ Transition: one may deny feeling ill, but recognize symptoms of all illness are present (“I am fine”) ▪ Acceptance: assume the sick role; acknowledge illness and takes measures to become well; patient may withdrawal from society (“I am sick”) ▪ Convalescence stage: process of recovery after illness and regaining health (“I feel better”) • Adaptation: if illness becomes chronic, recovery phase is replaced by adaptation • Maladaptation: lack of adjustment o Current health views: health is evaluated on a graduated scale or continuous spectrum ▪ Nursing as a caring profession ▪ Goal is primarily under the control of a physician o Health behavior: promotes health, prevent disease, detect disease ▪ Exercise, nutrition, physicals, immunizations o Illness behavior: determines actual state of health and seek suitable remedy for health remedies ▪ Seeing physicians, taking meds, going to clinics o Health literacy: knowledge and skill making health care decision o Health promotion & illness prevention: latest update of direction goals and objectives is healthy people 2030; comprehensive set of objectives for disease prevention and health promotion for nation (include new sections addressing opioid use) ▪ Primary prevention: avoids or delays occurrence of disease or disorder; being proactive!!! (ex-smoking cessation, alcohol cessation, maintaining a healthy weight, education, eating healthy, vaccines, vitamins) ▪ Secondary prevention: screening for disease guidelines for easily treated diseases if found early or detecting disease return (annual mammograms, colonoscopies, physicals, prescribed medications, TB screenings, pap smears) ▪ Tertiary prevention: rehabilitation measures after disease/disorder has stabilized and patient has gone through disease process (neuro rehab after stroke, rehab for arthritis) • Goal: to prevent more illnesses/disabilities to arise or come about ▪ Preventative: preventing illness (education, smoking cessation, immunizations, annual checkups) ▪ Primary: early detection and routine care (health screenings, nutrition counseling, prenatal care, blood pressure checks) ▪ Secondary: acute care (surgery, emergency care, labs and diagnostic treatment, cardiovascular rehab) ▪ Tertiary: special continuing care (chronic disease management with highly technical services) ▪ Restorative: rehabilitation (intermediate surgical postoperative care, rehab, home care) ▪ Continuing care: long term (chronic/hospice, personal) o Health disparity: how certain populations have higher risk of developing diseases than others ❖ Discuss why nurses need to apply a holistic approach to nursing care (mental health, culture, education, societal differences) o Holistic approach: considers biological, psychological, spiritual, sociological o Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs: focus on lowest level first and work way up; basic needs must be met before emotional needs; used to determine priorities ▪ Physical care is USELESS if no physiological needs can be met ❖ Compare racial & cultural differences in disease predisposition & communication between main cultures/races o Always be aware of client’s beliefs o NEVER assume patient does or does not adhere to culture’s beliefs o Culture sensitivity: remember each patient is different no matter their beliefs/values ❖ Common signs & symptoms of stress & ways nurses can help decrease it within patients (Know what triggers the stress to help patient find ways to cope or deal with stress) o Stress can be good or bad (GI issues, anxiety and depression, Hypertension) o Signs and symptoms: dry mouth, tachycardia, hypertension, inability to stay still, tachypnea, dizziness, anxiety, irritability, quick to anger o Nursing interventions: relaxation, imagery, massage, biofeedback, yoga, meditation, physical exercise o Coping: adjusting or solving problem o Defense mechanisms: strategies that protect us from increasing anxiety; reduces anxiety and secretions of stress hormones to find homeostasis ❖ Homeostasis: how our body keeps a sense of balance; tendency of biologic systems to maintain stable eternal environment by continuously adjusting to changes needed for survival o Stress disturbs organisms of homeostasis and causes body to attempt to adapt ❖ Adaptation: response to change; requires communication between the brain and various body systems o Brain is messenger (sends signals to achieve homeostasis) ❖ General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS): response to long-term exposure to stress o 1- Alarm stage: fight or flight (sympathetic nervous kicks in); reaction to stressful situation o 2- Stage of resistance: fight for homeostasis (parasympathetic nervous system); battle for equilibrium ▪ Body is usually able to adapt and fight off disease o 3- Stage of exhaustion: body can’t fight anymore; person is susceptible to death and disease ▪ Body succumbs to illness Ch 3: Legal & Ethical Aspects of Nursing (Williams) ❖ Ethics: societal views on right and wrong; non-negotiable; standards of contact o “Ethos”: Greek term meaning “character” o What’s legal may not be ethical ❖ Values: close to ethics; beliefs of individual; derived from ethical, cultural, societal, and religious background and traditions ❖ Provisions: o 1: respect human dignity, relationship with patients, nature of health, right to self, relationships with colleagues and others o 2: primacy of patients interests, conflict of interest for nurses, collaboration, professional boundaries o 3: rights and privacy and confidentiality, human participants in research, standards and review mechanisms, professional responsibility in promoting a culture of safety, patient health and safety by acting on questionable practice, patient protection and impaired practice o 4: authority and accountability and responsibility, nursing judgements decisions and actions, assignment and delegation of nursing tasks o 5: duties to self and others, promotion of personal health safety and well-being, preservation of wholeness of character, preservation of integrity, maintenance of competence and continuation of professional and personal growth o 6: environment and moral virtue, ethical obligation, responsibility of healthcare environment o 7: research and scholarly inquiry, developing maintaining and implementing professional practice standards, contributions through policy development o 8: health is a universal right, collaboration for health human rights and diplomacy, advance health and reduce disparities, collaboration for human rights in complex extreme or extraordinary situations o 9: articulation and assertion, integrity of profession, integrating social justice ❖ Roles & responsibilities of legal, ethical, & professional vocational nurses as members of health care team o RNs can delegate tasks, but still be held accountable o LVNs can assign duties o 5 rights of delegation and assigning: task, circumstance, person, supervisor, direction/communication ❖ Legal requirements for practice of nursing including confidentiality, planning care, & patient factors o Judicial law: establishes precedent;
