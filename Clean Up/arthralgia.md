Arthralgia refers to joint pain, a symptom that can be associated with various medical conditions. It can range from mild to severe and may be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-lasting). Common causes of arthralgia include:

- Arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis or [[Osteoarthritis]])
- Injuries or trauma to the joints
- Infections
- Autoimmune diseases (like lupus)
- Overuse or repetitive stress
- Inflammatory conditions (such as gout)

Treatment for arthralgia depends on its underlying cause and may include medications, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, or other interventions to manage pain and improve joint function.
