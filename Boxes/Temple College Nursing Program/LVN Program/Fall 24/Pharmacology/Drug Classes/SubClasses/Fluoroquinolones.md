### Adverse Reactions 
Common adverse effects include the following: 
- Nausea 
- Diarrhea 
- Headache 
- Abdominal pain or discomfort 
- Dizziness 
- [[photosensitivity]] (exaggerated skin reaction to sun exposure), which is a more serious adverse reaction seen with the administration of the fluoroquinolones, especially [[ofloxacin]]. 

The risk for aortic dissection or rupture when using fluoroquinolones is of concern. Therefore, these antibacterial [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] should not be used with clients diagnosed with an existing aortic aneurysm, hypertension, [[peripheral atherosclerosis]], or genetic [[Blood]] vessel disorders. 

The administration of any drug may result in a hypersensitivity reaction, which can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, be life-threatening. Mild [[hypersensitivity reactions]] may require only discontinuing the drug, whereas the more serious reactions require immediate treatment. Bacterial or fungal superinfections and [[pseudomembranous colitis]] may occur with the use of these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]].

### Contraindications
Fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in clients with a history of hypersensitivity to the fluoroquinolones, in children younger than 18   years, and in pregnancy ([[Preg Cat C]]). These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] also are contraindicated in clients whose lifestyles do not allow for adherence to the precautions regarding [[photosensitivity]]. 

Tendonitis and tendon rupture risk increase when taking a fluoroquinolone. For this reason, [[gemifloxacin]] is reserved for use in clients with chronic bronchitis only when [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] other alternatives are exhausted. Although this can happen at any age, those older than 60   years who also take [[Corticosteroids]] are at greater risk. 

Fluoroquinolones are used cautiously in clients with diabetes, renal impairment, or a history of seizures; older clients; and clients on dialysis.
