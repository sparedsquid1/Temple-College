A client with seasonal allergies has been prescribed a nasal spray and wants to know about the addictive nature of the nasal spray, the adverse reactions, and the harmful effects involved. Which nursing diagnosis should the nurse address while educating the client? A) Ineffective Health Management B) Anxiety C) Deficient Knowledge D) Readiness for Enhanced Health Management Answer: D Rationale: Readiness for Enhanced Health Management indicates a desire by the client to manage their own treatment regimen. It includes teaching about adverse drug reactions, harmful drug effects, and management of harmful effects. Ineffective Health Management helps in teaching clients who have complicated post-discharge medical regimens. Anxiety is appropriate for the client who has uncertainty and fear related to the regimen, for example, a person who is apprehensive about self-injections. Deficient Knowledge is used for clients who are deficient in cognitive knowledge and psychomotor skills.

A nurse is teaching the caregiver of a client with cancer how to administer the supplementation oxygen from a cylinder once the client goes home. Which activity is most effective for the nurse to use when evaluating the client's caregiver's understanding? A) Ask questions such as “Do you understand?” B) Ask the client's sibling to demonstrate the procedure. C) Ask the client's sibling to document the technique. D) Ask the client's sibling questions related to the procedure. Answer: B Rationale: To determine the effectiveness of teaching in this case, the nurse must evaluate the client's caregiver's knowledge of the materials presented. This can be done by asking the client's caregiver to demonstrate or explain the presented information. The nurse should not ask questions such as “Do you understand?” as the client may be uncomfortable admitting a lack of understanding. Asking questions related to the procedure may confuse the person. Asking the client's caregiver to document the technique would not provide enough information about whether or not the caregiver does understand what to do. Question Format: Multiple Choice Chapter: 5 Learning Objective: 5 Cognitive Level: Analyze Client Needs: Health Promotion and Maintenance Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Reference: p. 62, Evaluation 5. A client in a local health care center is presented information on drug administration by the nurse. Which factors would the nurse identify as having the least impact on the client's learning? A) Client's financial status B) Prior knowledge C) Prior perceptions D) Previous experiences Answer: A Rationale: Financial status would not have an impact on the client's learning. To interpret information using the cognitive domain, the client uses prior knowledge, perceptions, and previous experiences. The client's opinions and feelings are used in the affective domain.
