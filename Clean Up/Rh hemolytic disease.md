Rh hemolytic disease, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), is a condition that occurs when there is an incompatibility between the [[Blood]] types of a pregnant mother and her baby. This typically involves the Rh factor, a protein found on the surface of red [[Blood]] cells.

### Causes:
- **Rh Incompatibility:** The most common cause of Rh hemolytic disease is when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive baby. If the mother has been previously sensitized (exposed) to Rh-positive [[Blood]], usually through a previous pregnancy, [[miscarriage]], or [[Blood]] transfusion, her immune system can produce antibodies against the Rh factor.
- **Sensitization:** During pregnancy, or more commonly during childbirth, a small amount of the baby’s Rh-positive [[Blood]] may enter the mother’s bloodstream. If the mother is Rh-negative and not previously sensitized, her body may produce anti-Rh antibodies in response.
- **Subsequent Pregnancies:** In a future pregnancy with an Rh-positive baby, these antibodies can cross the [[placenta]] and attack the red [[Blood]] cells of the baby, leading to hemolysis (destruction of red [[Blood]] cells).

### Symptoms in the Newborn:
- **Anemia:** Destruction of red [[Blood]] cells leads to anemia, where the baby has fewer red [[Blood]] cells to carry oxygen.
- **Jaundice:** The breakdown of red [[Blood]] cells produces bilirubin, leading to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
- **Enlarged [[Liver]] and spleen:** The baby’s organs work harder to produce more red [[Blood]] cells, leading to enlargement.
- **Hydrops fetalis:** Severe cases can cause fluid buildup in the baby’s tissues and organs, leading to [[Heart]] failure and severe swelling (edema).
- **Kernicterus:** Extremely high levels of bilirubin can deposit in the brain tissue, leading to permanent brain damage.

### Diagnosis:
- **Maternal [[Blood]] tests:** Testing the mother's [[Blood]] for Rh antibodies during pregnancy can detect if she is sensitized.
- **[[amniocentesis]]:** A test of the amniotic fluid can assess the severity of the disease by measuring bilirubin levels.
- **[[ultrasound]]:** Can detect signs of hydrops fetalis or other complications in the fetus.
- **Cordocentesis:** Also known as percutaneous umbilical [[Blood]] sampling (PUBS), this test involves taking a [[Blood]] sample from the fetus to check for anemia and other issues.

### Prevention:
- **Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM):** This injection is given to Rh-negative mothers during pregnancy and after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. It prevents the mother’s immune system from becoming sensitized to Rh-positive [[Blood]].
- **Timing:** RhoGAM is typically given around 28 weeks of pregnancy and again within 72 hours after delivery, as well as after any event where fetal [[Blood]] might mix with the mother’s [[Blood]], such as [[miscarriage]], abortion, or trauma.

### Treatment:
- **For the Fetus:**
  - **Intrauterine transfusion:** In severe cases, [[Blood]] transfusions may be given to the fetus via the [[umbilical cord]] to treat anemia before birth.
  - **Early delivery:** In some cases, if the fetus is mature enough, early delivery might be recommended to treat the baby outside the womb.
  
- **For the Newborn:**
  - **Phototherapy:** Light therapy is used to break down excess bilirubin in the baby's [[Blood]].
  - **[[Blood]] transfusions:** May be necessary to replace the baby's damaged red [[Blood]] cells.
  - **Exchange transfusion:** In severe cases, this procedure involves replacing the baby’s [[Blood]] with fresh donor [[Blood]] to remove antibodies and bilirubin.

### Prognosis:
With early detection and treatment, many babies with Rh hemolytic disease can recover fully. However, severe untreated cases can result in serious complications, including brain damage, [[Heart]] failure, or death. The use of RhoGAM has significantly reduced the incidence of Rh hemolytic disease.
