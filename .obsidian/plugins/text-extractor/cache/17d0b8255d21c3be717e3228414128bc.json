The nurse is preparing to administer pramipexole to a client with Parkinson disease. The nurse notes the client is also prescribed verapamil. Which potential reaction should the nurse prioritize for careful monitoring? A) Cardiac symptoms B) Agonist effectiveness C) Toxicity of both drugs D) Psychotic behavior Answer: B Rationale: The nurse should assess for an increased risk of agonist effectiveness in the client. Increased risk of cardiac symptoms and increased risk of toxicity of both drugs are the effects of the interaction of COMT inhibitors with MAOI antidepressants and adrenergic drugs. Increased risk of psychotic behavior is the effect of the interaction of cholinergic blocking drugs with haloperidol.

A nurse has administered entacapone to a 55-year-old client with Parkinson disease. Which adverse reaction should the nurse prioritize? A) Increased hand tremor B) Constipation C) Urinary retention D) Dyskinesia Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should monitor for dyskinesia, which is an adverse reaction of the COMT inhibitors, in the client. The other adverse reactions include dizziness, hyperkinesia, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders, excessive dreaming, somnolence, and muscle cramps. A serious, and possibly fatal, adverse reaction that can occur with the administration of tolcapone, one of the COMT inhibitors, is liver failure. Increased hand tremor and constipation are adverse effects associated with the use of dopaminergic drugs. Urinary retention is an adverse reaction associated with the administration of cholinergic blocking drugs.

A nurse completed teaching a client with influenza A about the prescribed amantadine. The nurse determines the session was successful when the client correctly chooses which action to counter adverse reactions to the drug? A) Instruct the client to take ice chips frequently. B) Encourage the client to take small, frequent meals. C) Instruct the client to avoid protein-rich foods. D) Stop the use of the antiparkinsonism drug by the client. Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should instruct the client to suck on ice chips or hard candy (if allowed). The nurse should also instruct the client to take frequent sips of water throughout the day and between meals. The nurse encourages the client to have small, frequent meals when the client experiences a GI disturbance and not when the client reports dry mouth. The nurse does not need to instruct the client to avoid protein-rich foods because this will not reduce the client's discomfort due to dry mouth. The nurse should stop the use of the antiparkinsonism drug when the client reports severe nausea or vomiting and not when the client is experiencing dry mouth. If dry mouth is so severe that there is difficulty in swallowing or speaking, or if loss of appetite and weight loss occur, the dosage of the antiparkinsonism drug may be reduced but not stopped completely.

A 70-year-old client with Parkinson disease is prescribed an anticholinergic drug. Which finding on assessment should the nurse prioritize? A) Confusion and disorientation B) Choreiform movements C) Suicidal tendencies D) Psychotic episodes Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should assess for confusion and disorientation when caring for this elderly client receiving anticholinergic drug therapy. Individuals older than 60 years frequently develop increased sensitivity to anticholinergic drugs and require careful monitoring. Lower doses may also be required in such cases. Choreiform movements, suicidal tendencies, and psychotic episodes are serious adverse reactions associated with the use of levodopa, which is a dopaminergic drug.

A client has developed a hepatic injury related to the administration of tolcapone. Which activity does the nurse anticipate will be added to the plan of care for this client? A) Monitor the client for signs of tactile hallucinations. B) Monitor the client for signs of dystonic movements. C) Perform regular blood tests of the client. D) Perform serum transaminase level testing every day. Answer: C Rationale: A serious and potentially fatal adverse reaction to tolcapone is hepatic injury. The nurse should, therefore, perform regular blood testing to monitor liver function of the client as prescribed. The testing of serum transaminase levels may be ordered at frequent intervals such as every 2 weeks for the first year and every 8 weeks thereafter. The nurse does not need to perform serum transaminase level testing every day. The nurse should monitor for signs of dystonic movements when caring for a client receiving carbidopa and levodopa, not tolcapone. The nurse should monitor for signs of tactile hallucinations when caring for an elderly client receiving tolcapone.

A 70-year-old client with Parkinson disease is receiving pramipexole. Which potential adverse reaction should the nurse monitor the client for? A) Blurred vision B) Memory loss C) Visual hallucinations D) Muscular rigidity Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should monitor the elderly client who is administered a dopamine receptor antagonist for signs of visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations. Hallucinations occur more often in older adults than in younger adults receiving the antiparkinsonism drugs, especially when taking the dopamine receptor agonists. The incidence of hallucinations appears to increase with age. The nurse does not need to monitor the client's condition for signs of blurred vision, memory loss, and muscular rigidity, as these conditions are not known to occur in elderly clients due to the use of dopamine receptor agonists.

The health care provider has prescribed a cholinergic blocking drug for a client with Parkinson disease. Which finding in the health record alerts the nurse to the need for cautious administration? A) Decreased liver function B) History of hallucinations or psychosis C) Cardiovascular disease D) Pulmonary disease Answer: A Rationale: It is important for the nurse to know if the client has decreased liver or kidney function so that the cholinergic blocking drug can be administered cautiously in the client. Other conditions in clients that require cautious use include tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, tendency toward urinary retention, and obstructive disease of the urinary system or gastrointestinal tract. The cholinergic blocking drugs are given with caution to older adults. The nurse should use dopamine receptor agonist drugs with caution in clients with a history of hallucinations or psychosis or cardiovascular disease. The nurse should use dopaminergic drugs with caution in clients with pulmonary diseases.

A nurse is preparing to administer a COMT inhibitor to a client with Parkinson disease. The nurse should question this order if which condition is recorded in the medical record? A) Pregnancy B) Achalasia C) Peptic ulcers D) Glaucoma Answer: A Rationale: The nurse should confirm that the client is not pregnant or lactating and that the client does not have a hypersensitivity to the drug to ensure that the use of COMT inhibitors is not contraindicated. Achalasia, peptic ulcers, and glaucoma are not conditions that are contraindications to the use of COMT inhibitors. The use of cholinergic blocking drugs is contraindicated in clients with achalasia, peptic ulcers, and glaucoma.

The client is reporting GI disturbances after receiving the first dose of carbidopa/levodopa for Parkinson disease. Which action should the nurse prioritize for this client? A) Administer the next drug dose with milk. B) Withhold the next drug dose. C) Observe for alterations in blood pressure. D) Administer the next drug dose with meals. Answer: D Rationale: The nurse should administer the next drug dose with meals to manage gastrointestinal disturbances in a client who has been administered antiparkinsonism drugs. Withholding the next drug dose, administering the next drug dose with milk, or observing alterations in the client's blood pressure are not appropriate interventions when caring for a client who is experiencing GI disturbances with the first dose of antiparkinsonism drugs.

The nurse is providing care for a client with Parkinson disease. Which nursing intervention should the nurse prioritize during the ongoing assessment? A) Assess the client for ability to perform the daily activities. B) Observe the current mental condition of the client. C) Observe the client for various neuromuscular signs. D) Prepare a baseline for future evaluations of the client's drug therapy. Answer: C Rationale: The nurse should evaluate the client's response to drug therapy by observing the client for various neuromuscular signs to compare these observations with the data obtained during the initial physical assessment. The nurse should assess the client's ability to perform daily activities and observe the client's current mental condition before the drug is administered to the client as part of the preadministration assessment. During the preadministration assessment, before starting the drug therapy, the nurse also performs a physical assessment of the client to provide a baseline for future evaluations of drug therapy.

The nurse is assessing a client for the effectiveness of the antiparkinson drug. If the nurse determines the client has improvement in these movements, which factor will the nurse point out has improved? A) Akathisia B) Bradykinesia C) Achalasia D) Choreiform movements Answer: B Rationale: Bradykinesia refers to the slow movements associated with Parkinson disease. Akathisia refers to extreme restlessness and increased motor activity. Achalasia refers to the failure to relax, usually referring to the smooth muscle fibers of the GI tract. Choreiform movements refer to the involuntary muscular twitching of the limbs or facial muscles.

The nurse educates a client diagnosed with Parkinson disease and family about managing the chronic condition and important aspects about the prescribed medications. Which client statement indicates the need for further clarification? A) “I will suck on sugar free candies, ice chips to help keep my mouth moist.” B) “I will take my meds with meals to decrease gastrointestinal symptoms.” C) “I will have my family journal about any facial grimacing, protruding tongue, exaggerated chewing, head movements and report it at the next visit to my health care provider.” D) “I will work on my balance by enrolling into Tai Chi and practice the movements each day, and I will wear shoes with rubber soles when walking to decrease slipping.” Answer: C Rationale: The nurse needs to clarify teaching regarding the journaling process. It is alright to record symptoms, and report the symptoms to the primary care provider at the next appointment when the symptoms are not severe adverse reactions. The ones discussed included adverse symptoms requiring immediate holding of the antiparkinson drugs and calling the primary care provider about the reaction for further guidance. The client should have a plan to take care of dry mouth, a common side effect of antiparkinson drugs. Taking the meds with meals can help decrease gastrointestinal side effects. Tai Chi can help the client maintain balance and gain exercise. It is also important to wear rubber-sole nonslipping shoes and not walk bare foot to help prevent falls.
