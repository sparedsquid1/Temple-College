Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Answer Section MULTIPLE CHOICE 1. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Explain the predisposing causes, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and treatment of urinary tract infections. Page: 742 Heading: Urinary Tract Infections Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient’s symptoms support a diagnosis involving the urinary tract. Diabetic related sepsis is too broad of a term to apply to the patient’s manifestations. 2 There is no information in the question to support the presence of infection from hepatitis. 3 The symptoms presented indicate an involvement of upper urinary tract rather than the urethra and bladder. 4 The patient is exhibiting the symptoms of complicated pyelonephritis, which includes a high fever, flank pain, and existing diabetes mellitus. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 2. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: List risk factors and signs and symptoms of cancer of the bladder. Page: 747 Heading: Cancer of the Bladder Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Cellular Regulation Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 Routinely, the HCP may order a complete blood count. 2 A urine test for the presence of the enzyme telomerase is 90 percent accurate for the diagnosis of early or late bladder cancer. Given the patient’s symptoms and history, this is the most specific test that the HCP can order. 3 The patient does not exhibit the symptoms of a bladder infection. Urine for Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company cytology can be obtained to determine the presence of cancer cells. 4 A urine culture can be done because the symptoms of a bladder infection can be similar to the symptoms of bladder cancer. However, this is not the most specific test. PTS: 1 CON: Cellular Regulation 3. ANS: 3 Chapter: Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Discuss nursing care for a patient with an ileal conduit or continent reservoir. Page: 751 Heading: Incontinent Urinary Diversion Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Cellular Regulation Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The nurse will expect mucus in the patient’s urine because the diversionary pouch is created from part of the bowel, which is mucus producing. 2 With an ileal conduit, the urine will drain continuously from the reservoir. 3 Bladder continence is never obtained with an ileal conduit, the reservoir continuously drains from the stoma into a collection bag. 4 The surgery for an ileal conduit always includes the formation of an ileostomy through which the urine is drained. PTS: 1 CON: Cellular Regulation 4. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Explain the predisposing causes, symptoms, treatment, and teaching for kidney stones. Page: 747 Heading: Renal Calculi (Urolithiasis) Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient with severe flank pain described as renal colic is frequently prescribed narcotic medication for pain control. However, this is not the most important intervention. 2 The nurse is aware that an increase in fluids will assist in flushing the kidney stone through the urinary system. However, this is not the most important intervention. 3 Ambulation can be effective in moving a renal stone through the urinary system. Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company If the patient is in extreme pain or medicated with a narcotic, assistance is warranted. 4 The most important intervention for the nurse to implement involves straining all urinary output for the collection of any passed stones. The stones are then sent to the laboratory where the type can be identified and appropriate treatment implemented. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 5. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Discuss nursing care for a patient with an ileal conduit or continent reservoir. Pages: 751–752 Heading: Continent Urinary Diversion Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Continent urinary diversion, of either a Kock or Indiana pouch, is created for the convenience of the patient. An incontinent diversion requires the formation of a stoma and constant use of a collection pouch as opposed to intermittent catheterization through a valve opening. 2 If the bladder is destroyed by disease, either a continent or incontinent diversion can be considered. 3 The possibility of skin breakdown is more likely with an incontinent diversion; however, this reason alone is not a determination for formation of a continent diversion. 4 The failure of an incontinent urinary diversion is not necessarily a reason to form a continent urinary diversion. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 6. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Explain the predisposing causes, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and treatment of urinary tract infections. Page: 742 Heading: Types of Urinary Tract Infections Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 1 Continuous incontinence places the patient at risk for skin breakdown and not for urosepsis. 2 The patient who is unable to independently obtain fluids is at risk for dehydration or for a UTI. 3 The patient with an indwelling urinary catheter is at high risk for urosepsis; the possibility is increased by an already existing UTI. 4 The patient who had surgery for the placement of an ileostomy may be at risk for urosepsis; however, the patient with an indwelling catheter and a UTI is at greatest risk. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 7. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Explain the pathophysiology and nursing care for diabetic nephropathy, nephrosclerosis, hydronephrosis, and glomerulonephritis. Page: 744 Heading: Hydronephrosis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 Bilateral hydronephrosis will occur from a blocked urethra when the urine backs up to the kidneys. The condition is reversible with surgical resolution of the blockage. 2 With a blockage of the urethra, urine will back up into the bladder, but the bladder is not at risk for rupture. The urine will continue to back up past the bladder. 3 Irreparable damage to the kidneys can occur with the formation of hydronephrosis. Within hours, the blood vessels and renal tubules can be extensively damaged. Both kidneys are at risk with a urethral blockage. 4 With blockage of the urethra, it is possible for the urine to back up to the point of dilating the ureters. However, this condition is reversible with resolution of the blockage. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 8. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Plan nursing care for patients on hemodialysis. Page: 766 Heading: Hemodialysis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient is likely to experience low blood pressure causing weakness, dizziness, and nausea. 2 The patient is likely to experience increased clotting time related to the use of heparin to prevent blood clotting during dialysis. 3 Cardiac arrhythmias and angina can occur after dialysis because of a sudden fluid drop. 4 After dialysis, the patient is more likely to feel weak and fatigued, and possibly unable to even eat. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 9. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Planning care for patients on peritoneal dialysis. Page: 766 Heading: Peritoneal Dialysis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 A major complication of peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, which can be life threatening. The major cause of peritonitis is poor technique when connecting the bag of dialyzing solution to the peritoneal catheter. 2 Paralytic ileus and respiratory distress are not associated with peritoneal dialysis. 3 Paralytic ileus and respiratory distress are not associated with peritoneal dialysis. 4 Abdominal cramps can occur with this type of dialysis; however, they are not the most serious side effect of this treatment. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 10. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Explain the pathophysiology and nursing care for diabetic nephropathy, nephrosclerosis, hydronephrosis, and glomerulonephritis. Page: 755 Heading: Intrarenal Injury Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 This patient’s kidney injury is not caused by a pre- or postrenal injury. 2 This patient’s kidney injury is not caused by a pre- or postrenal injury. 3 Intrarenal kidney injury occurs when there is damage to the nephrons inside the kidney. Causes are ischemia, reduced blood flow, toxins, infectious processes leading to glomerulonephritis, trauma to the kidney, allergic reactions to radiograph dyes, and severe muscle injury. 4 Suprabladder is not a type of kidney injury. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 11. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 37.

Page: 770 Heading: Orthotopic Bladder Substitution Integrated Process: Teaching/Learning Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Application (Applying) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient who has orthotopic bladder substitution does not have a stoma. A “new” bladder is surgically formed and both the ureters and urethra are implanted. 2 The patient who has orthotopic bladder substitution is not prone to skin breakdown even though incontinence is sometimes a problem. 3 The patient who has orthotopic bladder substitution may need to perform intermittent catheterization as needed. The nurse needs to review this procedure during the recovery period. 4 The patient who has orthotopic bladder substitution will not need to wear an appliance. The patient will be able to urinate through the urethra normally. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 13. ANS: 4 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: List risk factors and signs and symptoms of cancer of the kidneys. Page: 750 Heading: Cancer of the Kidney Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integration—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Cellular Regulation Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 Men are more likely to develop cancer of the kidney, but rarely under the age of 45; smoking is a high risk for the disease; and hypertension can be caused by multiple conditions. This patient has two possible risks, smoking and gender. 2 This client has three risks for kidney cancer: age, obesity, and radiation exposure. 3 This client has two risks for kidney cancer: age and long-term kidney dialysis. 4 This client has four risks for kidney cancer: gender, age, smoking history, and chemical exposure. PTS: 1 CON: Cellular Regulation 14. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Plan nursing care for a patient with an acute kidney injury. Page: 730 Heading: Prerenal Injury Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Difficulty: Difficult Feedback 1 The patient may or may not have PKD; however, the condition is an intrarenal injury. 2 Medications such as NSAIDs for joint pain and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors for hypertension can cause prerenal injury by impairing the autoregulatory responses of the kidney by blocking prostaglandin, which is needed for renal perfusion. 3 An aminoglycoside is an antibiotic that is cleared by the kidneys and is nephrotoxic. However, nephrotoxicity from any cause is an intrarenal injury. 4 Any obstruction to the outflow of urine is considered to be a postrenal injury. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 15. ANS: 3 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Plan nursing care for patients with chronic kidney disease. Page: 753 Heading: Nursing Care for the Patient With Chronic Kidney Disease Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Physiological Adaptation Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Elimination Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient may or may not need oxygen therapy; this intervention requires a prescription by the HCP. 2 Measurement of abdominal girth provides information about ascites. Patients with renal failure may not initially exhibit abdominal ascites. There is a better nursing intervention. 3 Patients with acute or chronic renal failure must be weighed daily at the same time, on the same scale, wearing the same type of clothing. Any weight gain of 2 pounds or more indicates fluid retention. This is the most important nursing intervention. 4 Fluids may or may not need to be restricted; this intervention requires a prescription by the HCP. PTS: 1 CON: Elimination 16. ANS: 2 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Plan nursing care for patients on peritoneal dialysis. Page: 765 Heading: Peritoneal Dialysis Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient on peritoneal dialysis needs to perform the procedure in a clean environment. The nurse needs to be concerned about the cleanliness with several pets roaming around in the house. 2 It is important that the patient understands the symptoms that need to be reported to the HCP. The symptoms of infection or peritonitis must have immediate treatment. This is the nurse’s least concern. 3 The patient must use sterile technique when attaching and instilling the dialysate to prevent the introduction of pathogens or microbes into the abdominal cavity. Clean technique is a matter of concern. 4 The nurse is concerned if the patient limits dietary protein intake. The patient on peritoneal dialysis loses proteins through the peritoneal membrane. Increased protein is needed. This is a matter of concern for the nurse. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care 17. ANS: 1 Chapter: Chapter 37. Nursing Care of Patients With Disorders of the Urinary System Objective: Discuss nursing care for a vascular access site. Page: 763 Heading: Vascular Access Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: Physiological Integrity—Reduction of Risk Potential Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Patient-Centered Care Difficulty: Moderate Feedback 1 The patient will have an arteriovenous (AV) fistula formed; placement is in the nondominate arm. Therefore, all needle sticks and blood pressures should be avoided in this arm to prevent damage to the veins. 2 A central venous catheter may be placed temporarily until the AV fistula is healed and developed. Long use of a central catheter should be avoided due to the risk for infection. 3 There is no need for the patient to shower with antimicrobial soap before or after the establishment of an AV fistula. 4 The AV fistula is most commonly placed on the patient’s arm. Tight clothing on the arm needs to be avoided, but there are no restrictions about under clothing. PTS: 1 CON: Patient-Centered Care MULTIPLE RESPONSE Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 18.
