Adams–Stokes syndrome, also known as Stokes–Adams syndrome, is a condition characterized by sudden, transient episodes of syncope (fainting) due to a temporary lack of [[Blood]] [[flow]] to the brain. This is typically caused by an abnormal [[Heart]] rhythm, specifically a significant bradycardia (slow [[Heart]] rate) or asystole (complete cessation of [[Heart]] activity) resulting from a conduction block in the [[Heart]].

### Key Features:
1. **Syncope**: Sudden fainting spells are the hallmark symptom.
2. **[[Heart]] Rhythm Abnormalities**: These include severe bradycardia or temporary asystole, often due to issues such as complete [[Heart]] block.
3. **Recovery**: Patients usually regain consciousness spontaneously once the [[Heart]] rhythm normalizes, often within a few seconds to a minute.
4. **Pallor and Weakness**: Before fainting, a person may experience pallor (paleness) and weakness.
5. **Convulsions**: In some cases, convulsions or seizure-like activity can occur if the brain is deprived of oxygen for an extended period.

### Causes:
- **Complete [[Heart]] Block**: The most common cause, where the electrical signals from the atria to the [[Ventricles]] are completely blocked.
- **Sick Sinus Syndrome**: A condition where the sinus node (the [[Heart]]'s natural pacemaker) doesn't function properly.
- **Ventricular Tachycardia**: A fast [[Heart]] rhythm originating from the [[Ventricles]] can also lead to decreased cardiac output and syncope.

### Diagnosis and Treatment:
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Key diagnostic tool to identify the type of arrhythmia causing the episodes.
- **Holter Monitor**: Continuous ECG monitoring over 24-48 hours to capture transient events.
- **Pacemaker**: The definitive treatment for most cases, especially those caused by complete [[Heart]] block, is the [[implantation]] of a permanent pacemaker to maintain a regular [[Heart]] rhythm.
- **Medication**: In some cases, medications may be used to manage underlying conditions that contribute to the arrhythmia.

Adams–Stokes syndrome is a serious condition that requires medical attention to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.
