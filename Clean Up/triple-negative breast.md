Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks the three most common types of receptors known to fuel most breast cancer growth: [[estrogen]] receptors (ER), [[progesterone]] receptors (PR), and excess [[HER2-positive breast]] protein. This means that TNBC does not respond to hormonal therapy or therapies that target [[HER2-positive breast]] receptors, making it more challenging to treat.

Key characteristics of TNBC include:

1. **Aggressiveness**: TNBC tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. It grows quickly, is more likely to have spread by the time it is found, and is more likely to come back after treatment.

2. **Prognosis**: The prognosis for TNBC is generally poorer than for other breast cancer types. However, the prognosis can vary widely depending on factors like the stage at diagnosis, the tumor size, and how well the cancer responds to treatment.

3. **Treatment**: Since TNBC does not have hormone receptors or excess [[HER2-positive breast]] protein, treatment options are limited to chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. Recently, immunotherapy and targeted therapies have become available for some patients with TNBC.

4. **Demographics**: TNBC is more common in younger women, particularly those under the age of 50. It is also more prevalent among African American and Hispanic women compared to other ethnic groups.

5. **Genetics**: TNBC is more likely to be associated with mutations in the [[BRCA1]] [[gene]], which can increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

Early detection and aggressive treatment are crucial for managing TNBC effectively. Research is ongoing to find more effective treatments and to better understand the biology of this cancer subtype.
