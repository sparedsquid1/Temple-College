Pancytopenia is a medical condition characterized by the reduction of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] three major [[Blood]] cell types: red [[Blood]] cells (anemia), white [[Blood]] cells ([[leukopenia]]), and platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]). This condition can result from various underlying causes, including bone marrow disorders, certain infections, autoimmune diseases, exposure to toxic chemicals, or the side effects of medications. Symptoms may include fatigue, increased susceptibility to infections, and a higher tendency to bruise or bleed. Diagnosis typically involves [[Blood]] tests and bone marrow examination, and treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause.
