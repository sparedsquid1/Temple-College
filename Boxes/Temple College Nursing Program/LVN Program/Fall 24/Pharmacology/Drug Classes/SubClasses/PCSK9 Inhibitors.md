### Adverse Reactions 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are a class of LDL-lowering [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] used for clients who have genetic familial [[hyperlipidemia]] or are at very high risk for cardiovascular disease (Myerson, 2016). Therapy for genetic familial [[hyperlipidemia]] begins with diet modification and statin [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]. If this is not successful, then the drug is changed to a PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9 is an enzyme that binds with LDL and prevents it from being removed from the [[Blood]]. These inhibitor [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are [[Monoclonal antibodies]] that block the enzyme process and lower LDL cholesterol. Two [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], [[alirocumab]] (Praluent) and [[evolocumab]] (Repatha), are approved for this treatment option. These [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], which are administered subcutaneously only once or twice monthly, are successful in lowering LDL cholesterol, yet are expensive (over $ 14,000 annually). This is compared with the yearly cost of a statin drug at approximately $ 250/ year (Santye, 2017). In addition, there is concern regarding these [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] and a possibility of cognitive adverse reactions.
