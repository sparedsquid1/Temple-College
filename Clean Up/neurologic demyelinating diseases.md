Neurologic demyelinating diseases are a group of disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This damage disrupts the normal transmission of electrical impulses along the nerves, leading to a range of neurological symptoms.

Key examples of neurologic demyelinating diseases include:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: An autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the myelin in the [[CNS]] ([[CNS]]), leading to symptoms like muscle weakness, [[Vision]] problems, balance and coordination issues, and cognitive impairments.

2. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**: A rare inflammatory condition that typically follows a viral infection or vaccination, causing widespread myelin damage in the brain and [[Spinal cord]]. Symptoms can include [[Fever]], headache, confusion, and neurological deficits.

3. **Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)**: An autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the optic nerves and [[Spinal cord]], leading to [[Optic neuritis]] and transverse myelitis, causing [[Vision]] loss, paralysis, and sensory disturbances.

4. **Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome ([[Guillain-Barre syndrome]])**: A condition where the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves' myelin sheath, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis that can progress rapidly.

5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: A chronic counterpart to [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]], characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the limbs due to peripheral nerve damage.

6. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: A rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV) that targets the white matter of the brain, leading to severe neurological deficits.

Diagnosis of these diseases typically involves [[Clinical Evaluation]], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture, and various [[Blood]] tests. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, slowing disease progression, and addressing underlying causes, often involving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.
