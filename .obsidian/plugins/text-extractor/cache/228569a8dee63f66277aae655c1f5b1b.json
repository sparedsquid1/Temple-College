Has framework of cartilage and dense Air passageway; prevents food from entering connective tissue. Opening (glottis) can be closed by epiglottis or vocal lower respiratory tract folds. Houses vocal folds (true vocal cords). Voice production Trachea Flexible tube running from larynx and dividing inferiorly into two Air passageway; cleans, warms, and moistens â€˜main bronchi. Walls contain C-shaped cartilages that are incomplete incoming air posteriorly where connected by trachealis. Bronchial tree Consists of right and left main bronchi, which subdivide within the Air passageways connecting trachea with alveoli; lungs to form lobar and segmental bronchi and bronchioles. Bronchiolar cleans, warms, and moistens incoming air walls lack cartilage but contain complete layer of smooth muscle. Constriction of this muscle impedes expiration. Alveoli Microscopic chambers at termini of bronchial tree. Walls of simple Main sites of gas exchange squamous epithelium overlie thin basement membrane. External surfaces are intimately associated with pulmonary capillaries. Special alveolar cells produce surfactant. Reduces surface tension; helps prevent lung collapse Lungs Paired composite organs that flank mediastinum in thorax. Composed House respiratory passages smaller than the primarily of alveoli and respiratory passageways. Stroma is elastic main bronchi connective tissue, allowing lungs to recoil passively during expiration. Pleurae Serous membranes. Parietal pleura lines thoracic cavity; visceral pleura Produce lubricating fluid and compartmentalize covers external lung surfaces. lungs","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
