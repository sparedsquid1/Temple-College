Electronic records are usually kept for 5-10 years, longer in some states Only health care professionals directly caring for the patient, or those involved in research or teaching, should have access to the chart Patient information should not be discussed with anyone not directly involved in the patient’s care The medical record is the property of the hospital. Clients do have a right to information contained in the chart. METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION (CHARTING) Source-oriented (narrative) charting Problem-oriented medical record (POMR) charting Focus charting Charting by exception Computer-assisted charting Case management system charting 5 6 6/8/2024 4 SOURCE-ORIENTED OR NARRATIVE CHARTING • Organized according to source of information • Separate forms for nurses, physicians, dietitians, and other health care professionals to document assessment findings and plan the patient’s care • Narrative charting requires documentation of patient care in chronologic order SOURCE-ORIENTED OR NARRATIVE CHARTING (CONT’D) • Advantages • Information in chronologic order • Documents patient’s baseline condition for each shift • Indicates aspects of all steps of the nursing process • Disadvantages • Documents all findings makes it difficult to separate pertinent from irrelevant information • Requires extensive charting time by the staff • Discourages physicians and other health team members from reading all parts of the chart 7 8 6/8/2024 5 EXAMPLE OF SOURCE-ORIENTED (NARRATIVE CHARTING) PROBLEM- ORIENTED MEDICAL RECORD CHARTING (POMR) Focuses on patient status rather than on medical or nursing care Five basic parts: database, problem list, plan, progress notes, and discharge summary 9 10 6/8/2024 6 PROBLEM-ORIENTED MEDICAL RECORD CHARTING (POMR) (CONT’D) • Advantages • Documents care by focusing on patients’ problems • Promotes problem-solving approach to care • Improves continuity of care and communication by keeping relevant data all in one place • Allows easy auditing of patient records in evaluating staff performance or quality of patient care • Disadvantages • Results in loss of chronologic charting • More difficult to track trends in patient status • Fragments data because more flow sheets required PIE CHARTING • P—problem identification • I—interventions • E—evaluation • Follows the nursing process and uses nursing diagnoses while placing the plan of care within the nurses’ progress notes 11 12 6/8/2024 7 EXAMPLE OF PIE (PROBLEM, INTERVENTION, EVALUATION) CHARTING QUESTION 1 Monica, a nurse in the operating room, knows that charting must be all of the following except: 1) subjective. 2) accurate. 3) brief. 4) complete. 13 14 6/8/2024 8 FOCUS CHARTING • Directed at nursing diagnosis, patient problem, concern, sign, symptom, or event • Three components: • D: data, A: action, R: response (DAR) OR • D: data, A: action, E: evaluation (DAE) FOCUS CHARTING (CONT’D) • Advantages • Compatible with the use of the nursing process • Shortens charting time: many flow sheets, checklists • Disadvantages • If database insufficient, patient problems missed • Doesn’t adhere to charting with the focus on nursing diagnoses and expected outcomes 15 16 6/8/2024 9 EXAMPLE OF FOCUS CHARTING CHARTING BY EXCEPTION • Based on the assumption that all standards of practice are carried out and met with a normal or expected response unless otherwise documented • A longhand note is written only when the standardized statement on the form is not met 17 18 6/8/2024 10 CHARTING BY EXCEPTION (CONT’D) • Advantages • Highlights abnormal data and patient trends • Decreases narrative charting time • Eliminates duplication of charting • Disadvantages • Requires detailed protocols and standards • Requires staff to use unfamiliar methods of recordkeeping and recording • Nurses so used to not charting that important data is sometimes omitted COMPUTER- ASSISTED CHARTING • Electronic health record (EHR) • Computerized record of patient’s history and care across all facilities and admissions • Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) • Provides efficient work flow • Automatically routes orders to appropriate clinical areas 19 20 6/8/2024 11 COMPUTER-ASSISTED CHARTING (CONT’D) • Documentation done as interventions are performed using bedside computers • Variations depending on the system • Some produce flow sheets with nursing interventions and expected outcomes • Others use a POMR format to produce a prioritized problem list COMPUTER-ASSISTED CHARTING (CONT’D) • Advantages • Date and time of the notation automatically recorded • Notes always legible and easy to read • Quick communication among departments about patient needs • Many providers have access to patient’s information at one time • Can reduce documentation time • Quick retrieval of electronic records • Reimbursement for services rendered is faster and complete • Can reduce errors 21 22 6/8/2024 12 COMPUTER-ASSISTED CHARTING (CONT’D) • Disadvantages • Sophisticated security system needed to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing records • Never leave the terminal while part of the client’s health record is on the screen • Initial costs are considerable • Implementation can take a long time • Significant cost and time to train staff to use the system • Computer downtime can create problems of input, access, and transfer of information CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CHARTING A method of organizing patient care through an episode of illness so clinical outcomes are achieved within an expected time frame and at a predictable cost A clinical pathway or interdisciplinary care plan takes the place of the nursing care plan 23 24 6/8/2024 13 ACCURACY IN DOCUMENTATION Be specific and definite in using words or phrases that convey the meaning you wish expressed Words that have ambiguous meanings and slang should not be used in charting BREVITY IN DOCUMENTATION • Sentences not necessary • Articles (a, an, the) may be omitted • The word “patient” omitted when subject of sentence • Abbreviations, acronyms, symbols acceptable to the agency used to save time and space • Choose which behaviors and observations are noteworthy 25 26 6/8/2024 14 LEGIBILITY AND COMPLETENESS IN DOCUMENTATION • If writing not legible, misperceptions can occur • Be sure to include as much information as needed • If an error is made on charting, draw a straight line through the error, initial, and date WHAT TO DOCUMENT • Completeness is more important than brevity (see Boxes 7-1 through 7-4 for documentation guidelines) • To ensure accuracy in documentation, chart immediately after providing care. 27 28 6/8/2024 15 QUESTION 2 Madison, a pediatric nurse, prefers charting by exception. She realizes all of the following are true except: 1) charting by exception was developed in 2005 by a group of nurses at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Sarasota, Florida. 2) the goal is to decrease the lengthy narrative entries of traditional systems. 3) charting by exception is based on the assumption that all standards of practices are carried out. 4) a longhand note is written only when the standardized statement on the form is not met. QUESTION 3 Mrs. Smith, LPN, has just charted the following assessment on her patient. 2/14/2008 3:00 PM VS stable. Voided 450 mL clear straw- colored urine. Pt denies pain but appears tired. Amy Smith, LPN Which of the following entries is incorrect? 1) Time of entry 2) Nurse stating an opinion 3) No line before name 4) All of the above 29 30 6/8/2024 16 QUESTION 4 Sally went into her patient’s room to administer an antibiotic. Her patient states, “I am not going to take another pill because they aren’t working.” What should Sally do? 1) Leave the pill on the bedside table and come back in a few minutes. 2) Throw the pill in the trashcan. 3) Circle the medication on the medication record, give a reason for the refusal in the progress notes, and notify the physician. 4) Crush up the medication in the patient’s food and inform the charge nurse. 31","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
