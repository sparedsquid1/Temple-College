### **Summary of Chapter 51: Sensory System Function, Data Collection, and Therapeutic Measures (Vision and Hearing)**

#### **I. Overview of Sensory System Function**

- The sensory system includes vision and hearing, which rely on specialized structures and nerves.
- The **eye** consists of accessory structures (eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, and lacrimal glands) and internal components like the **sclera, choroid, retina, and optic nerve**.
- The **ear** is divided into the outer ear (auricle, canal, cerumen), middle ear (eardrum, ossicles, Eustachian tube), and inner ear (cochlea, semicircular canals).
    

#### **II. Data Collection for Sensory Disorders**

##### **Vision Assessment**

- **Subjective Data**: Patient's health history, symptoms, and vision concerns.
- **Objective Data**:
    - **Visual acuity tests**: Snellen chart (20/20 normal, 20/200 legal blindness), LogMAR chart.
    - **Ocular motility tests**: Six cardinal fields of gaze, corneal light reflex.
    - **Pupil assessment**: Reflexes, intraocular pressure (normal: 10-21 mmHg).
    - **Internal eye examination**: Performed by a healthcare provider.

##### **Hearing Assessment**

- **Subjective Data**: Patient history, hearing loss symptoms.
- **Objective Data**:
    - **Behavioral observations**: Communication patterns, responsiveness.
    - **Auditory tests**: Whisper test, Rinne test (air vs. bone conduction), Weber test (lateralization).
    - **Balance tests**: Romberg test for equilibrium.

#### **III. Diagnostic Tests**

- **Eye Tests**: Exudate culture, digital imaging, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography.
- **Ear Tests**: Audiometric testing, tympanometry, caloric test, CT scan, MRI.

#### **IV. Aging and Sensory Changes**

- **Vision**: Presbyopia (lens rigidity), night vision difficulties, glare sensitivity, reduced depth perception.
- **Hearing**: Presbycusis (gradual high-frequency hearing loss).

#### **V. Therapeutic Measures**

- **For Vision**: Eye hygiene, safety measures, eye irrigation, medication administration (punctal occlusion for eye drops), use of guide dogs.
- **For Hearing**: Assistive devices (hearing aids, service dogs), medications (anti-infectives, antihistamines, cerumenolytics).

# **NCLEX-Style Questions with Rationales**

---

### **1. The nurse is collecting data from an elderly patient experiencing difficulty with night vision. What is the most likely cause?**

A. Increased lacrimal secretions  
B. Decreased pupil size  
C. Increased retinal function  
D. Thickening of the choroid layer

✅ **Correct Answer:** B. Decreased pupil size  
**Rationale:** Aging leads to a **decrease in pupil size**, which reduces the amount of light entering the eye, making **night vision difficult**.

---

B. The sound of thunder  
C. A high-pitched alarm  
D. The rumbling of an engine

✅ **Correct Answer:** C. A high-pitched alarm  
**Rationale:** **Presbycusis** is **age-related hearing loss** that primarily affects **high-frequency sounds** first.

---

### **3. The nurse is assessing a patient’s visual acuity using a Snellen chart. What result indicates legal blindness?**

A. 20/30  
B. 20/100  
C. 20/200  
D. 20/50

✅ **Correct Answer:** C. 20/200  
**Rationale:** **Legal blindness** is defined as a visual acuity of **20/200 or worse** with correction.

---

### **4. A patient reports dizziness when standing. The nurse performs a Romberg test. What is the correct nursing action?**

A. Ask the patient to sit  
B. Stand close to the patient  
C. Dim the lights  
D. Close the curtains

✅ **Correct Answer:** B. Stand close to the patient  
**Rationale:** The **Romberg test** evaluates **balance**. The nurse should stand **nearby to prevent falls**.

---

### **5. The nurse is teaching a patient about instilling eye drops. What instruction should be given?**

A. Apply drops directly onto the pupil  
B. Rub the eye vigorously after administration  
C. Use punctal occlusion after instillation  
D. Administer drops before removing contact lenses

✅ **Correct Answer:** C. Use punctal occlusion after instillation  
**Rationale:** **Punctal occlusion** prevents systemic absorption of medication by **pressing on the tear duct**.

---

### **6. Which test is used to evaluate air vs. bone conduction in hearing?**

A. Snellen test  
B. Rinne test  
C. Weber test  
D. Romberg test

✅ **Correct Answer:** B. Rinne test  
**Rationale:** The **Rinne test** compares **air conduction to bone conduction** using a tuning fork.

---

### **7. A patient reports that their hearing aid is not working. What should the nurse check first?**

A. Soak the device in warm water  
B. Replace the battery  
C. Increase the volume to maximum  
D. Clean any cerumen buildup

✅ **Correct Answer:** D. Clean any cerumen buildup  
**Rationale:** **Cerumen buildup** can block sound transmission, causing the device to malfunction.

---

### **8. Which diagnostic test requires checking for prior dye reactions?**

A. Optical coherence tomography  
B. Tympanometry  
C. Indocyanine green angiography  
D. Electronystagmogram

✅ **Correct Answer:** C. Indocyanine green angiography  
**Rationale:** **Indocyanine green angiography** uses a contrast dye that may cause allergic reactions.

---

### **9. What is the normal range for intraocular pressure (IOP)?**

A. 0-10 mmHg  
B. 10-21 mmHg  
C. 22-30 mmHg
