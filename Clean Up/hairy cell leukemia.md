Hairy Cell [[Leukemia]] (HCL) is a rare, slow-growing type of chronic B-cell [[Leukemia]]. It gets its name from the appearance of the cancerous [[B cells]] under a microscope, which have fine, hair-like projections on their surface. HCL typically affects middle-aged and older adults and is more common in men than in women.

### Causes:
The exact cause of hairy cell [[Leukemia]] is not well understood, but it is thought to involve genetic mutations in the [[B cells]]. These mutations cause the cells to multiply abnormally and accumulate in the bone marrow, spleen, and [[Blood]].

### Symptoms:
HCL often progresses slowly, and symptoms may not appear for many years. When they do occur, symptoms can include:
- **Fatigue**: Due to anemia, a common result of the disease affecting the bone marrowâ€™s ability to produce enough red [[Blood]] cells.
- **Frequent Infections**: Caused by a low white [[Blood]] cell count ([[neutropenia]]).
- **Easy Bruising or Bleeding**: Due to a low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]).
- **Enlarged Spleen (Splenomegaly)**: This is one of the hallmark signs of HCL and can cause a feeling of fullness or discomfort in the abdomen.
- **Enlarged [[Liver]] (Hepatomegaly)**: Less common but may occur.
- **Weight Loss**: Often due to loss of appetite.
- **Night Sweats**: Common in many types of [[Leukemia]].

### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of HCL involves several steps:
- **[[Blood]] Tests**: A complete [[Blood]] count (CBC) often shows low levels of red [[Blood]] cells, white [[Blood]] cells, and platelets. Examination of the [[Blood]] smear under a microscope may reveal the characteristic "hairy" cells.
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: The definitive diagnosis is typically made by examining bone marrow samples, where hairy cells are usually abundant.
- **[[flow]] Cytometry**: A [[Lab]] technique used to identify specific markers on the surface of [[Leukemia]] cells, helping to confirm the diagnosis.
- **Imaging Tests**: [[ultrasound]] or CT scans may be used to assess the size of the spleen and [[Liver]].

### Treatment:
While HCL is a chronic condition, it is often manageable with treatment. Not [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] patients need immediate treatment, especially if they are asymptomatic. When treatment is necessary, options include:
- **Chemotherapy**: The most common [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] used are purine analogs, such as **[[cladribine]] (2-CdA)** or **[[pentostatin]] (DCF)**. These are highly effective and can induce long-term remission in most patients.
- **Targeted Therapy**:
  - **[[rituximab]]**: A monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein on [[B cells]], used in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent in relapsed cases.
  - **BRAF Inhibitors**: Such as **[[vemurafenib]]** for patients with the BRAF V600E mutation, which is present in many cases of HCL.
- **Interferon-alpha**: An older treatment option that is less commonly used today but may be effective in some cases, especially in patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy.
- **Splenectomy**: Surgical removal of the spleen may be considered if the spleen is severely enlarged or if the disease does not respond to other treatments.

### Prognosis:
The prognosis for hairy cell [[Leukemia]] is generally favorable, especially with modern treatments. Most patients achieve long-term remission, and many can live for decades with good quality of life. However, because HCL is a chronic disease, regular follow-up and monitoring are necessary to manage any relapses or complications.

While HCL is not usually curable, it is treatable, and many patients respond well to therapy, maintaining remission for long periods.
