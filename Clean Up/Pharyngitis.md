Pharyngitis is the medical term for inflammation of the pharynx, which is the part of the throat situated behind the [[Mouth]] and nasal cavity, and above the esophagus and [[Larynx]]. This condition is commonly referred to as a sore throat. Pharyngitis can be caused by various factors, including:

1. **Viral Infections**: The most common cause, often associated with colds, flu, or other [[Respiratory]] viruses.
2. **Bacterial Infections**: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) is a common bacterial cause, leading to strep throat.
3. **Allergies**: Reactions to allergens such as pollen, dust, or pet dander can cause pharyngitis.
4. **Environmental Factors**: Dry air, pollution, or smoking can irritate the pharynx.
5. **Other Causes**: Fungal infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or other underlying medical conditions.

Symptoms of pharyngitis may include:

- Sore throat
- Difficulty swallowing
- Redness and swelling in the throat
- [[Fever]]
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck

Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Viral pharyngitis usually resolves on its own, while bacterial pharyngitis may require antibiotics. Symptomatic relief can be achieved with rest, hydration, throat lozenges, and over-the-counter pain relievers.
