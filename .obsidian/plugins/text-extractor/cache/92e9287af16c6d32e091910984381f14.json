But protein is increased for patients receiving dialysis due to the loss of protein during dialysis such as Eggs & Meat. o Sodium is restricted to minimize sodium & fluid retention (based on pt’s bp) o Potassium is restricted (especially later in the disease when the kidneys cannot get rid of it, or with a patient that has Oliguria) o Calcium may be increased or supplemented because of poor absorption related to faulty vitamin D activation. o Phosphorus is restricted because of high blood levels related to hypocalcemia o Saturated fat and cholesterol are restricted for patients with hyperlipidemia. o Fluids are restricted to prevent fluid overload. o Most patients are given iron, Folic acid, Vitamins and minerals to supplement the restricted diet. ❖ Best method to determining fluid volume status: o Obtaining Daily Weights are the best way to determine fluid volume status ❖ Glomerulonephritis is most commonly associated with what prior infections: o Streptococcus infection (strep throat) ❖ Phenazopyridine- what is it and what are the side effects/teaching points: o Analgesic that relieves symptoms/pain for a UTI and other urinary problems o Also known as Pyridium o This helps with bladder spasms o Educate your patient that this medication may turn the urine orange/red o Side Effects: Headache, rash, purities, GI disturbances, red-orangish urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin or sclera. ❖ Renal calculi- care management, education: o Patho: calcium buildup o S/S: flank pain, dysuria, decreased flow o Treatment/Education: o Increase fluids (drink 2-3 quarts of fluids, IV fluids) o Avoid sweetened beverages and grapefruit juice o Take analgesics for pain (Tylenol or Ibuprofen) o Don't wear tight clothing o Advise patients to wear cotton underwear o Strain urine o Administer hydrochlorothiazide o Consult a dietician o Urocit-K (potassium citrate)- restores chemicals in urine that prevent crystals from forming ❖ UTI- who is at risk?: o Elderly population because they have decreased thirst sensation, diminished immune function, diabetes, o Women because of smaller urethra and estrogen decline as they age o Men if they have enlarged prostate ❖ ESRD- what is it? Know the nephron loss stages, care management: o End stage renal disease occurs when 90% of nephrons are lost. o Serum BUN, serum Creatinine levels are always elevated o These patients make urine, but does not filter out the waste products o Dialysis or kidney transplant is required to survive o Diabetes is the leading cause of ESRD STAGE: KIDNEY FUNCTION: GFR: table 37.9 1 Slight Decrease 90 or greater 2 Mild Decrease 60-89 3 Moderate Decrease 30-59 4 Severe Decrease 15-29 5 Dialysis/Transplant Less than 15 o Care management for ESRD: Kidney transplant, dialysis, Blood glucose control, ACE inhibitors & ARB medications (slow the progression), routine urine tests, renal diet ❖ Bladder cancer signs and symptoms… what’s most common? o S/S: Painless Hematuria, frank hematuria, bladder irritability, urine retention, fistula formation, pelvic pain, painful urination, pain in the lower back. o Cancer of the bladder is the most common kind of cancer of the urinary tract. o There is a strong correlation between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer o Bladder cancer is typically diagnosed at a late stage in women o Common sites for metastasis include the liver, bones, and lungs o Most common is Caucasians o It occurs most commonly in men and older adults ❖ Breast Cancer s/s, what's most common, lifestyle contributions. o S/S: A lump or thickening of breast tissue, change in shape, dimpling of the overlying skin or retraction of the nipple, clear or bloody nipple discharge, swelling, tenderness, discoloration can indicate inflammatory breast cancer, a rare but deadly form. o Most diagnosed in women o Lifestyle contributions: Increasing age, family history of breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer, high fat diet, high alcohol intake, treatment with estrogen (especially those without progestins), early menarche, late menopause, and first pregnancy after age of 30. ❖ Surgical aftercare assessments and education: o Post-Op pain control o Assess vital signs o Assess incision for bleeding o Measure circumference of arms daily and compare o Educate post-op self-care o Educate patients if hospitalized to NOT use affected arm(s) for BP checks, venipuncture, and injections because it could further compromise tissue integrity. o Use therapeutic communication and understand that patients may experience body image disturbances. o Provide social support to help support their coping skills ❖ New Ileum conduit post-op care: o Also known as a Urostomy o This is when a 6–8-inch section of the ileum or colon is removed and used as a conduit for urine, then the remaining sections of the bowel are stitched back together. The isolated section of bowel is closed off on one end, the ureters are stitched into it, and the other end is brought out as a stoma on the abdomen. o Urine from a urostomy contains mucus because it travels through the ileum o Educate patient how to monitor the stoma (stoma should be pink, blue indicates cyanosis, stomach pouch cut out should be bigger than patients' stoma) o Ensure adequate urinary output and watch for obstructions o Application of a disposable pouch to ileal conduit 1. Gather supplies- washcloth, towels, water, pouch, clean gloves 2. Empty old pouch and gently remove it by pushing down on skin while lifting on the flange 3.
