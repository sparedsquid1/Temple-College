{"path":"Boxes/ChelseaFies/MNN Mod V-Copy(1).pdf","text":"Maternal-Neonatal Nursing Module V Exam Chapter 13: Preterm and Post-term Newborn ❖ Gestational age o Large for gestational age (LGA): over 8.8lbs (4,000g) o Small for gestational age (SGA): low birth weight (preterm- <37 weeks gestation) ▪ Causes: multiple births, maternal illness, poverty, smoking, alcohol, drugs • Prenatal care should be a PRIORITY ❖ Assessment of preterm infant o Physical: transparent and loose skin, superficial veins, lack of subcutaneous fat, lanugo, abundant vernix, short extremities, few creases on soles of feet, protruding abdomen o RDS: (resp distress syndrome); deficient surfactant; 60breaths/min; tachypnea with grunting, nasal flaring, cyanosis, intercostal and sternal retractions ▪ More severe: edema, lassitude, apnea ▪ Treatment: surfactant usually appears at 24 weeks gestation; give mom corticosteroids, monitor vials and ABGs, place infant in warmer, cluster care to give uninterrupted rest, maintain pulse ox at 92% or higher o Apnea: cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer; in newborn it’s related to immature nervous system ▪ Often accompanied with bradycardia (less than 110 beats/min) o Neonatal hypoxia: inadequate oxygen at cellular level o Poor control of body temperature: lack of brown fat (insulation); associated with cold stress; decreased skin temp, increased RR and apneic periods, bradycardia, skin mottling (can see veins), lethargy ▪ Treatment: place skin probe in upper right quadrant of abdomen and not over bony prominence or under a diaper; maintain temp at 97-98; place in a radiant warmer o Hypoglycemia: insufficient glycogen and fat store; <40 in term or <30 in a preterm; may become to weak to eat and get nutrition; fast heart rate, jitters, apnea, high pitched cry, pale or bluish color, poor body tone ▪ Treatment: monitor glucose levels and may need nasogastric or parenteral feedings o Bleeding: deficient prothrombin and clotting factors; susceptible to injury ▪ Care: monitor neuro status, fontanelles (report bulging), lethargy, poor feeding, and seizures (signs of increased ICP) ▪ Treatment: slight fowler’s, cluster care o Poor nutrition: small stomach capacity, immature sphincter muscles, immature suck and swallow, inadequate store of nutrients ▪ Treatment: gavage feedings (or gavage or parenteral; good because they don’t compromise cardiorespiratory status) ▪ Care: monitor abdominal girth and auscultate sounds; place infant on right side or abdomen after feedings (promote gastric emptying and reduce aspiration) ▪ Readiness for feedings: strong gag reflex and sucking/rooting reflexes o Immature kidneys: improper elimination of waste products that leads to electrolyte imbalances; can easily become dehydrated ▪ Care: intake and output, weigh diapers, assess fontanelles and turgor o Jaundice: immature liver that causes yellowing of the skin; at risk for brain damage; pathological occurs within 24 hours of birth and is more serious ▪ Care: monitor sclera, skin, mucous membranes ▪ Treatment: phototherapy, sunlight ❖ Nursing goals for preterm infant: improve respiration, maintain body heat, conserve energy, prevent infection, proper nutrition and hydration, good skin care, record all observations, support and help out parents ❖ Special needs of newborn o Nutrition: possible gavage feedings until 34 weeks when infant can breathe and eat at the same time, possible TPN, bowel sounds, meconium, supplemental vitamins o Positioning: side lying or prone (on abdomen) o Thermoregulation: incubator/warmer, cover head, radiant heat cribs o Kangaroo care: skin to skin contact with caregivers; infant wears only a diaper and a hat; promotes bonding ❖ Post term infant: gestation >42 weeks; determine if EDC is truly post term; must be delivered because by then, placenta loses ability to nourish fetus o Characteristics: newborn emaciated, meconium stained, long hair and nails, dry/peely skin, creases cover soles of feet, limited vernix and lanugo ❖ Post term pregnancy problems o Asphyxia: due to chronic hypoxia while in uterus due to deteriorated placenta o Meconium aspiration: hypoxia and distress may cause relaxation of anal sphincter and can get into lungs and cause choking o Poor nutritional status: depleted glycogen reserves can cause hypoglycemia o Increased RBC production: polycythemia due to intrauterine hypoxia o Difficult delivery due to increased size of infant o Birth defects o Seizures: due to hypoxic state and lack of oxygen Chapter 14: The newborn with perinatal injury or congenital malformation ❖ High risk newborn intervention o Temperature: minimize cold stress, maintain temp at 96.8-97.7, continuous monitoring, prevent rapid warming/cooling, use a cap to prevent heat loss o Flood and fluids: monitor for hypoglycemia, assess for tolerance of tube feeds, monitor hydration, assess gastric residual, bowel sounds, stool patterns, girth, monitor weight o Respiratory function: semi-prone or side lying, maintain patent airway, stimulation, monitor oxygen therapy, assess effort (grunting, nasal flaring, cyanosis, apnea) ❖ Hydrocephalus: increased cerebrospinal fluid within brain’s ventricles o S/S: large head, delayed development, lack of appetite, tendency to vomit easily, poor resistance to infection o Care: measure head daily, frequent position changes to support the head, prevent skin breakdown, side lying after feedings, monitor for increased ICP/BP/RR, furosemide or acetazolamide o Pre-op nursing care: (same as above), assess fontanelles and head circumference, watch for signs of infection or cold o Post-op nursing care: monitor for increased ICP, inflammation at operative site, position dependent of fontanelle, skin assessment, head/chest/abdomen circumference, pain, strict intake and output, observe for fluid overload, feed when active bowel sounds are heard, keep surgery incision clean and dry, education and community resources ❖ Spina Bifida: group of CNS disorders characterized by malformation of spinal cord; patch of hair in lumbosacral area o Care: prevent injury and contracture development, good skin care and nutrition, surgery would be required ▪ After surgery, pt have leg paralyzation (will be incontinent of urine and feces) ▪ Important to make habilitation goals/training o Pre-op nursing care: cover with sterile dressing and keep moist, position lying prone o Post-op nursing care: neuro, prevent infection, latex-free environment, bonding ❖ Cleft lip: fissure or opening in upper lip; o Care: monitor for signs of oral, respiratory or systemic infection, elbow restraints, feeding to avoid suckling motion; prep for surgery ▪ Cheiloplasty: before 6 months of age • post-op nursing care: prevent sucking or crying, positioning, prevent infection and injury, emotional needs, pain relief and sedation o Pre-op nursing care: multidisciplinary approach, issues ▪ NO SUCTIONING OF MOUTH FOR BABIES WITH CLEFT PALATE REPAIR o Post-op nursing care: nutrition, oral hygiene, speech, diversion, complications o Goals of care: union of cleft, improved feeding/speech/dental development, nurturing positive self-image, instruct parents to report s/s of infection ❖ Club foot: one of the most common deformities of skeletal system o Care: splinting/casting, passive stretches, parent teaching, guidance ▪ Clubfoot treatment over 4-6 weeks ❖ Phenylketonuria (PKU): inherited error in metabolism; toxic levels of phenylalanine of >20 (common protein in amino acid) due to inability of body to convert o Can cause: mental retardation, convulsions, behavior problems, skin rash, musty body odor o Tested minimum 24 hours after beginning milk; retest in 7-10 days to catch false neg o Educate to stay away from meat, dairy, dry beans, nuts, eggs, cereals, fruit and veggies o AVOID sweetener aspartame (it is converted to phenylalanine in body) ❖ Down syndrome: most common chromosomal abnormalities; 1/700 incidence o S/S: decreased muscle tone, excess skin at nape of neck, flattened nose, upward slanting eyes, small ears and mouth, wide/short hands with short fingers, separated joints between bones of skull, single crease in palm of hand, white spots on color part of eye o Care: counseling parents and siblings ❖ Erythroblastosis fetalis: Rh- mom and Rh+ dad create a Rh+ fetus o RhoGam decreases incidence: 72 hrs after delivery of Rh+ infant, administer at 28th week of pregnancy, after spontaneous/therapeutic abortion, amniocentesis o S/S: hyperbilirubinemia (leads to jaundice) ▪ Jaundice on first day is ALWAYS pathological and NEEDS prompt intervention ▪ can cause anemia and lead to fetal hypoxia or heart failure o Care: risk for injury, impaired skin integrity, deficient fluid volume, hyperthermia or hypothermia, injury, imbalanced nutrition, parental anxiety ▪ Infant born with cardiac failure and edema as a result of hemolytic disease NEEDS immediate transfusion of fresh whole blood ▪ Assessing jaundice: look at skin and sclera; blanching over bony prominences enhances eval of jaundice o Nursing tips: assess jaundice and phototherapy tips ❖ Meconium Aspiration syndrome: serious condition in which a newborn breathes a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid into lungs around delivery time o Care: assist with amnioinfusion, assess respiratory distress, supportive care ▪ Warmth, supplemental oxygen, energy conserving plan, NICU (intubation or mechanical ventilation) ❖ Infant born to diabetic mother: can lead to macrosomia o Care: close monitoring of vitals, early feeding, frequent assessment of BG levels for first 2 days of life (keep above 40) o S/S: irritability, tremors, resp distress ❖ Transient Tachypnea (TTN): respiratory distress syndrome type II; resolves in 3 days o Risk factors: maternal diabetes, c-section, male sex, maternal asthma, delivery at lower gestational age o S/S: tachypnea, chest retractions, grutning, cyanosis o Care: observation and oxygen ❖ Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS): baby suffers from withdrawal after drugs pass from mom to baby o Care: swaddle, quiet environment, reduce external stimuli, observe for seizures","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
