Match the following anatomical terms (column B) with the appropriate description or function (column A). Column A Column B 1. region of the cell body from which the axon originates 2. secretes neurotransmitters 3. receptive region of a neuron 4. insulates the nerve fibers 5. site of the nucleus and is the most important metabolic area 6. may be involved in the transport of substances within the neuron 7. essentially rough endoplasmic reticulum, important metabolically 8. impulse generator and transmitter 5. Draw a “typical” multipolar neuron in the space below. Include and label the following structures on your diagram: cell body, nucleus, nucleolus, Nissl bodies, dendrites, axon, axon collateral branch, myelin sheath, nodes of Ranvier, axon ter- minals, and neurofibrils. a. axon b. axon terminal c. axon hillock d. dendrite e. myelin sheath f. neurofibril g. neuronal cell body h. Nissl bodies 6.

Receptors (thermal and pain in the skin) Effector (biceps brachii muscle) 8. Correctly identify the sensory (afferent) neuron, interneuron (association neuron), and motor (efferent) neuron in the figure below. Which of these neuron types is (are) unipolar? ______________________________________________________________ Which is (are) most likely multipolar? _____________________________________________________________________ Unipolar neuron Bipolar neuron Multipolar neuron 9. Describe how the Schwann cells form the myelin sheath and the neurilemma encasing the nerve processes. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 7. What anatomical characteristic determines whether a particular neuron is classified as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar? ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ Make a simple line drawing of each type here. The number of processes issuing from the cell body Sensory neuron Motor neuron, interneuron Motor neuron Interneuron Sensory neuron Schwann cells begin to wrap themselves around the axon in jelly roll fashion, thus forming a tight coil of membranous material which forms the myelin sheath. The neurilemma is the bulge of Schwann cell cytoplasm external to the myelin sheath and the outermost (exposed) Schwann cell membrane. 7. Identify the 3 neuron types as either multipolar, pseudounipolar, or bipolar. pseudounipolar? Pseudounipolar neuron Sensory","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
