Mucositis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the [[Digestive]] tract, which can cause pain and discomfort. It often occurs as a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, particularly in cancer treatment. Symptoms can include sore [[Mouth]] or throat, redness, swelling, and ulceration. Management typically involves pain relief, maintaining good oral hygiene, and sometimes using medications or special [[Mouth]] rinses.
