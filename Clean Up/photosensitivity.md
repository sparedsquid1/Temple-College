Photosensitivity refers to an increased sensitivity or abnormal reaction of the skin or eyes to sunlight or artificial light sources. It can result in discomfort, pain, or visible changes in the skin when exposed to light.

### Types of Photosensitivity
1. **Skin Photosensitivity**: 
   - **Photodermatitis**: An abnormal skin reaction to sunlight, which can include redness, rashes, blisters, or peeling.
   - **Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE)**: A common condition where the skin develops a rash after exposure to sunlight.
   - **Solar [[urticaria]]**: A rare condition where hives develop on the skin shortly after exposure to sunlight.

2. **Ocular Photosensitivity**: 
   - Similar to **[[photophobia]]**, it involves discomfort or pain in the eyes when exposed to light. 

### Causes of Photosensitivity
- **Medications**: Certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] can make the skin or eyes more sensitive to light, including:
  - Antibiotics like [[Tetracyclines]]
  - [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]] (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]) like [[ibuprofen]]
  - Some antidepressants and [[Antipsychotics]]
  - [[Diuretics]]
- **Medical Conditions**:
  - **Lupus**: An autoimmune disease that often causes photosensitivity as a symptom.
  - **Porphyria**: A group of disorders caused by abnormalities in heme production, which can lead to severe skin reactions to sunlight.
  - **Dermatomyositis**: An inflammatory disease that can cause skin rash and muscle weakness, often triggered by sun exposure.
- **Genetic Disorders**:
  - **Xeroderma Pigmentosum**: A rare genetic condition where individuals are extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.

### Symptoms
- **Skin**:
  - Redness
  - Itching or burning sensation
  - Blisters or peeling
  - Rash or hives
- **Eyes**:
  - Squinting or discomfort in bright light
  - Tearing
  - Headache
  - Eye pain

### Prevention and Treatment
- **Avoidance of Triggers**: Limiting sun exposure, especially during peak hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF.
- **Protective Clothing**: Wearing hats, long sleeves, and UV-protective sunglasses.
- **Medication Review**: Consulting with a healthcare provider to review medications that might contribute to photosensitivity.
- **Topical Treatments**: Corticosteroid creams or soothing lotions may be used to treat skin reactions.
- **Eye Protection**: Using sunglasses that block UV rays and avoiding bright lights or glare.

If you suspect photosensitivity due to a medication or a condition, it's important to seek medical advice to determine the cause and appropriate management.
