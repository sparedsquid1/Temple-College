Diarrhea is a sign of hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. 5. Hyperactive DTRs are a sign of hypocalcemia. PTS: 1 CON: Fluid and Electrolyte Balance ORDERED RESPONSE Copyright © 2019 F. A. Davis Company 29. ANS: 3, 2, 1, 4 Chapter: Chapter 6 Nursing Care of Patients With Fluid, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Imbalance Objective: 7. Categorize common causes, signs, and symptoms, and treatments for sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium imbalances. Pages: 63–68 Heading: Electrolyte Imbalance Integrated Process: Clinical Problem-Solving Process (Nursing Process) Client Need: SECE—Coordinated Care Cognitive Level: Analysis (Analyzing) Concept: Fluid and Electrolyte Balance Difficulty: Difficult Feedback: The nurse should first assess the patient with the very low potassium level experiencing heart palpitations, because hypokalemia can cause cardiac dysrhythmias (circulation). The second patient the nurse should assess is the patient with fluid volume excess and pitting edema (circulation). The third patient the nurse should assess is the patient reporting loose stools and nausea, followed by the patient with a normal calcium level and negative Trousseau sign.
