Phototoxicity refers to a condition in which exposure to light, particularly ultraviolet (UV) light, causes damage to the skin or other tissues. This can occur when certain substances, such as [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] or chemicals, make the skin more sensitive to light.

### Key Points about Phototoxicity:

1. **Mechanism**: Phototoxic reactions happen when a photosensitive substance (such as a drug or chemical) absorbs UV light and then releases energy that damages cells or tissues.

2. **Symptoms**: Symptoms of phototoxicity typically include:
   - Redness
   - Swelling
   - Pain or discomfort
   - Blistering or peeling of the skin
   - In severe cases, it can lead to more serious skin damage.

3. **Common Causes**:
   - **Medications**: Certain [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], such as antibiotics (e.g., [[Tetracyclines]]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]]), and some [[Diuretics]], can cause phototoxic reactions.
   - **Chemicals**: Some chemicals used in topical products, like sunscreens or acne treatments, may also be phototoxic.

4. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is often based on the patient's history of exposure to the suspect substance and the characteristic symptoms of skin damage following exposure to sunlight.

5. **Management**:
   - **Avoidance**: The primary strategy is to avoid sunlight or UV exposure when using known phototoxic substances.
   - **Protection**: Using sunscreens and wearing protective clothing can help minimize exposure.
   - **Treatment**: Symptomatic treatment may include soothing lotions or [[Corticosteroids]] to reduce inflammation and discomfort.

6. **Prevention**: To prevent phototoxic reactions, it's important to be aware of the photosensitizing effects of certain medications or chemicals and take appropriate precautions, such as avoiding excessive sun exposure.

If you suspect you are experiencing phototoxicity, especially if you've recently started a new medication or used a new topical product, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate evaluation and management.
