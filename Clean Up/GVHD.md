Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a medical condition that occurs when the immune cells from a transplanted donor graft (usually bone marrow or stem cells) recognize the recipient's body as foreign and attack it. GVHD is a common and serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ([[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]]), where the donor and recipient are different individuals.

### Types of GVHD:
1. **Acute GVHD:**
   - **Timing:** Usually occurs within the first 100 days after transplantation, but it can sometimes develop later.
   - **Symptoms:** Commonly affects the skin, [[Liver]], and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include:
     - Skin: Rash, redness, or peeling.
     - [[Liver]]: Elevated [[Liver]] enzymes, jaundice.
     - Gastrointestinal tract: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

2. **Chronic GVHD:**
   - **Timing:** Typically occurs after 100 days post-transplant, though it can develop earlier.
   - **Symptoms:** Can affect many organs and tissues, leading to:
     - Skin: Thickening, tightness, or changes in pigmentation.
     - Eyes: Dryness, irritation.
     - [[Mouth]]: Sores, dry [[Mouth]], difficulty [[Eating]].
     - Lungs: Shortness of breath, cough.
     - [[Liver]]: Chronic [[Liver]] dysfunction.
     - Gastrointestinal tract: Weight loss, malabsorption.
     - Muscles and joints: Weakness, stiffness, or pain.

### Risk Factors:
- **HLA mismatch:** The degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient is crucial. A closer match reduces the risk of GVHD.
- **Donor type:** Related donors (siblings) are generally preferred, but unrelated donor transplants carry a higher risk of GVHD.
- **Age:** Older recipients and older donors have a higher risk of developing GVHD.
- **Gender mismatch:** Female donors to male recipients, especially if the donor has been pregnant, increase the risk.

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]:** Based on symptoms, physical examination, and history of transplant.
- **Biopsies:** Skin, [[Liver]], or gastrointestinal biopsies can confirm GVHD by showing characteristic tissue changes.
- **Laboratory Tests:** [[Liver]] function tests, complete [[Blood]] count, and other tests may support the diagnosis.

### Treatment:
- **Immunosuppressive Therapy:** The primary treatment for GVHD involves immunosuppressive [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] such as [[Corticosteroids]] (e.g., [[prednisone]]) and calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., [[cyclosporine]], [[tacrolimus]]). These medications aim to suppress the immune response that causes GVHD.
- **Supportive Care:** Includes treatments for symptoms and complications, such as skin creams for rashes, medications for gastrointestinal symptoms, and supportive therapies for affected organs.

### Prognosis:
- **Acute GVHD:** The outcome depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases may resolve with treatment, while severe cases can be life-threatening.
- **Chronic GVHD:** This can be a long-term condition requiring ongoing management. It can significantly affect quality of life and may lead to organ damage or other complications.

GVHD is a complex and serious condition that requires careful management by a specialized medical team. Advances in transplant techniques and GVHD prevention have improved outcomes, but it remains one of the major challenges in stem cell transplantation.
