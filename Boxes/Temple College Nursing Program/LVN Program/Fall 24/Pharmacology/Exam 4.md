PTs should be instructed to flush twice because it can also cause staining. 
Meds to pay attention too:
•	[[amoxicillin]] antibiotic, antibacterial and anti-infective used to treat UTIs it’s a common wide spectrum antibiotic drug
•	[[fosfomycin]] antibacterial and anti-infective  has to be administered in a 3-g, one dose packet that has to be administered by being dissolved in 90-120 ml of water (not hot water) and is administered directly after being dissolved in water.

**** READ ME  ALERT 
Can cause chronic and acute pulmonary issues. Notify the PCP immediately if S/S include [[Fever]], chills, SOB, CP, Cough, or difficulty breathing. Withhold the next dose until seen by the PCP. 



•	[[phenazopyridine]]  analgesic  important this does not treat the UTI it only treats the pain and discomfort of the UTI.  
may cause a reddish orange discoloration of urine and cause discoloration or tears and whites of eyes 
***** READ ME ALERT*** 
Do not take this drug for more than two days if you are also taking an antibiotic for the treatment if a UTI.
