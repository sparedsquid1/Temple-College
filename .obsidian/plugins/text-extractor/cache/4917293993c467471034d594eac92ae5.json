Fertilization • Occurs when a sperm penetrates an ovum and they unite • Takes place in the outer third of the fallopian tube, near the ovary • As soon as it occurs, a chemical change in the membrane around the fertilized ovum prevents further sperm from penetrating the ovum Sex Determination • Sperm can carry either an X or Y chromosome • Male determines the gender of the fetus • pH of female reproductive tract influences survival rate of the X- and Y- bearing sperm, including speed of motility • XX results in female • XY results in male How Genetics Determine Your Baby's Gender 3 4 8/9/2024 3 Cell Differentiation Cell Differentiation • Chorion • Embryonic side of placenta • Amnion • Amniotic fluid • Yolk Sac • A cavity develops on the 9th day after fertilization • Functions only during embryonic life • Initiates production of red blood cells • Continues until fetal liver takes over, about 6 weeks • Umbilical cord encompasses yolk sac which then degenerates • Germ Layers • Ectoderm • Mesoderm • Endoderm Accessory Structures of Pregnancy • Placenta • Umbilical cord • Fetal circulation • Supports fetus 6 5 6 8/9/2024 4 The Placenta • Organ for fetal respiration, nutrition, and excretion • Produces four hormones • Progesterone • Estrogen • Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) • Human placental lactogen (hPL) 7 Placental Hormones PROGESTERONE • Functions during pregnancy • Maintains uterine lining for implantation of the zygote • Reduces uterine contractions to prevent spontaneous abortion • Prepares the glands of the breasts for lactation • Stimulates testes to produce testosterone, which aids the male fetus in developing the reproductive tract ESTROGEN • Stimulates uterine growth • Increases the blood flow to uterine vessels • Stimulates development of the breast ducts to prepare for lactation • Effects of estrogen, not related to pregnancy • Increased skin pigmentation • Vascular changes in the skin and mucous membranes of nose and mouth • Increased salivation 8 7 8 8/9/2024 5 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) • Causes the corpus luteum to persist and continue production of estrogen and progesterone to sustain pregnancy • hCG is detectable in maternal blood as soon as implantation occurs (usually 7 to 9 days after fertilization) 10 9 10 8/9/2024 6 Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) • Also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) • hPL causes decreased insulin sensitivity and utilization of glucose by mother • Helps to make more glucose available to fetus to meet growth needs 11 Umbilical Cord • Lifeline between mother and fetus • Two arteries carry blood away from fetus • One vein returns blood to the fetus • Wharton’s jelly covers and cushions cord vessels • The umbilical cord is usually inserted near the center of the placenta A V A 11 12 8/9/2024 7 • Foramen ovale: diverts most blood from the right atrium directly to the left atrium, rather than circulating it into the lungs • Ductus Arteriosus: Diverts most blood from the pulmonary artery into the aorta • Ductus venosus: diverts some blood away from the liver as it returns from the placenta Fetal Circulation Formation of Twins Twins 13 14 8/9/2024 8 Health Promotion • Undernutrition • Can result in permanent changes in fetal structure, physiology, and metabolism • Can influence development of conditions such as heart disease and stroke in adulthood • Exposure to toxins in utero • Can also influence health in later life Which is correct about monozygotic, or identical twins? A. They are always contained in a single amniotic sac B. They may be the same or different sex C. They result from the fertilization of one ovum by one sperm D. They have increased n incidence with the use of fertility drugs 15 16 8/9/2024 9 The human ovum and sperm contain how many chromosomes? A. 23 B. 46 C. 69 D. 92 Which of the following doe the umbilical cord contain? A. One artery and one vein B. Two arteries and one vein C. Two veins and one artery D. Two veins and two arteries 17 18 8/9/2024 10 Fill in The Blank An ovum survives about ____________ hours after ovulation. Sperm survives up to __________ days after ejaculation. If the ovum is fertilized by a sperm bearing a Y chromosome, the baby will be a ______________. If the ovum is fertilized by a sperm bearing an X chromosome, the baby will be a ______________. Fertilization usually occurs in the _____________________. The fertilized ovum usually implants in the _______________ section of the _________________ uterus. Most fetal blood bypasses circulation to the lungs by way of the? A. Ductus venosus B. Foramen ovale C. Umbilical vein D. Umbilical artery 19 20","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
