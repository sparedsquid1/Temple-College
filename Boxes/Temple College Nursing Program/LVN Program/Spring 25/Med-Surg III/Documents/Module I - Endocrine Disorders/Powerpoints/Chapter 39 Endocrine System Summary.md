**[[Endocrine System]] Summary**

The [[Endocrine System]] is a network of glands that produce [[Hormones]], which are chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions. The main endocrine glands include the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, [[Pancreas]], and ovaries/[[testes]].

### Pituitary Gland

* Produces [[Hormones]] that regulate other endocrine glands
* Stimulates or inhibits the release of [[Hormones]] from other glands
* Has two main parts: anterior (produces [[Growth Hormone]], prolactin, etc.) and posterior (produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and [[oxytocin]])

### Thyroid Gland

* Produces thyroid [[Hormones]] (T3 and T4)
* Regulates metabolism, energy production, and growth
* Can be overactive or underactive, leading to conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism

### Adrenal Glands

* Produce two main types of [[Hormones]]: [[glucocorticoids]] ([[cortisol]]) and [[Mineralocorticoids]] (aldosterone)
* Regulate electrolyte balance, [[Blood]] pressure, and stress response
* Can be overactive or underactive, leading to conditions such as [[Cushing's syndrome]] or [[Addison's disease]]

### Pancreas

* Produces [[Hormones]] that regulate [[Blood]] sugar levels: insulin and [[glucagon]]
* Regulates glucose metabolism and energy production

### Ovaries/Testes

* Produce sex [[Hormones]] ([[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] in females; [[testosterone]] in males)
* Regulate reproductive functions, including puberty, menstruation, and fertility

**Endocrine Disorders**

* **Hyperthyroidism**: overactive thyroid gland
	+ Symptoms: weight loss, increased appetite, nervousness, tremors
	+ Nursing diagnosis: Risk for Hyperthermia, [[anxiety]]
* **Hypothyroidism**: underactive thyroid gland
	+ Symptoms: fatigue, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation
	+ Nursing diagnosis: Risk for Fluid Volume Deficit, Disturbed Body Image
* **[[Cushing's syndrome]]**: overproduction of [[cortisol]]
	+ Symptoms: weight gain, thinning skin, acne, hypertension
	+ Nursing diagnosis: Risk for Impaired Skin [[integrity]], Excess Fluid Volume
* **[[Addison's disease]]**: underproduction of adrenal [[Hormones]]
	+ Symptoms: fatigue, weakness, weight loss, darkening of skin
	+ Nursing diagnosis: Risk for Deficient Fluid Volume, Disturbed Body Image
* **Diabetes mellitus**: high [[Blood]] sugar levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance
	+ Symptoms: polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, blurred [[Vision]]
	+ Nursing diagnosis: Risk for Unstable [[Blood]] Glucose, Disturbed Body Image

**Nursing Care for Endocrine Disorders**

* Monitor vital signs, electrolyte balance, and [[Blood]] glucose levels regularly
* Administer medications as prescribed to regulate hormone production or replacement
* Educate patients about their condition, treatment plan, and self-care activities (e.g., medication administration, exercise, diet)
* Provide emotional support and counseling for patients with endocrine disorders
