Parents are encouraged to room-in ▪ Strive for consistency with caregivers ▪ May wear own clothes/bring toys ▪ Flexible schedules ▪ Designed to meet the needs of growing children ▪ Familiar rituals and routines must be incorporated into the plan of care . Communicate at EYE LEVEL! ❖ Factors that affect a child's reaction to hospitalization: . Childs age . Amount of preparation given . Previous hospital experiences . Support of family and medical staff . Childs emotional health . Security of home life ❖ Separation Anxiety: . Occurs in infants 6 months or older, most pronounced in toddler age. (ages 1-3) - 3 Stages: - Protest: 1st stage • Infants: crying, screaming, looking for parent • Toddlers: verbally or physically attacks strangers, continuous crying, try to escape - Despair: 2nd stage • All Ages: Withdraws from others, sad, uninterested in environment, uncommunicative regresses to earlier behavior. - Denial or Detachment: 3rd stage • . All Ages- Increased interest in surroundings, interacts with caregivers and strangers, appears happy. *These behaviors represent a superficial adjustment to loss* *Children are adaptable, so permanent issues are possible but rare* ❖ Pain: .
