Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues and organs. This systemic condition can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, [[Heart]], lungs, and [[Blood]] cells.

### Key Features:
1. **Autoimmune Response**: The immune system produces antibodies that target healthy tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage.
2. **Multisystem Involvement**: SLE can affect multiple organs and systems, leading to a broad range of symptoms.

### Common Symptoms:
- **Fatigue**: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy.
- **Joint Pain and Swelling**: Often affecting the small joints of the hands and feet.
- **Skin Rashes**: The characteristic butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and nose, known as a malar rash, is common. Other skin rashes and [[photosensitivity]] (sensitivity to sunlight) are also typical.
- **[[Fever]]**: Recurrent low-grade fevers.
- **Kidney Involvement**: Lupus nephritis, inflammation of the kidneys, can lead to proteinuria (protein in the urine) and renal impairment.
- **Neurological Symptoms**: Headaches, dizziness, memory loss, and, in severe cases, seizures or strokes.
- **Cardiopulmonary Symptoms**: Pleuritis (inflammation of the lining of the lungs), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the [[Heart]]), and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- **Hematological Disorders**: Anemia, [[leukopenia]] (low white [[Blood]] cell count), [[thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count).

### Diagnosis:
- **[[Clinical Evaluation]]**: Assessment of symptoms and physical examination.
- **Laboratory Tests**: 
  - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test: Positive in most SLE patients.
  - Anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies: More specific markers for SLE.
  - Complement levels: Often low during disease flares.
  - [[Blood]] and urine tests: To check for organ involvement, such as kidney function tests and urinalysis.
- **Imaging Studies**: To assess organ damage or involvement, such as echocardiograms or chest X-rays.

### Treatment:
- **Medications**: 
  - **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] ([[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]])**: For pain and inflammation.
  - **[[Corticosteroids]]**: To reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response.
  - **Antimalarials**: Such as [[hydroxychloroquine]], for skin and joint symptoms.
  - **[[Immunosuppressants]]**: Such as [[methotrexate]], azathioprine, or [[mycophenolate]], for severe organ involvement.
  - **Biologics**: Such as belimumab, which targets specific immune pathways involved in SLE.
- **Lifestyle and Supportive Care**: 
  - **Sun Protection**: Using sunscreen and protective clothing to avoid triggering skin symptoms.
  - **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent follow-ups with healthcare providers to monitor disease activity and manage complications.
  - **Healthy Lifestyle**: Including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management.

SLE is a complex and highly variable disease, with periods of remission and flare-ups. Treatment is tailored to the individual, focusing on controlling symptoms, preventing flares, and protecting organs from damage.
