{"path":"Boxes/ChelseaFies/Module 1 (NHI III)-Copy(1).pdf","text":"MED SURG.MOD 1 CHAPTER 38:Understanding the Endocrine System ➢ Endocrine System contains: o Pineal Gland: “mystery gland”; “third eye” ▪ Secretes melatonin (for sleep, reproduction and cancer prevention) o Pituitary Gland (hypophysis): controlled by hypothalamus ▪ Anterior • Growth hormone (GH): regulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and by growth hormone inhibiting hormone (GHIH or somatostatin); stimulated by hypothalamus • Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): stimulates growth and secretions of thyroid gland; stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) • Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): stimulates secretions of cortisol and related hormones from adrenal cortex; stimulated from Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) o CRH: produced during exercise, stress, disease or hypoglycemia ▪ Posterior • Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): also known as “vasopressin”; increases water reabsorption by kidney tubules and urine output is decreased (maintains blood pressure) o Major fluid loss: hemorrhages; large amount of ADH secretion will result in arteriole vasoconstriction • Oxytocin (prolactin): contractions and breastfeeding; acts as a positive feedback loop o Thyroid Gland ▪ Triiodothyronine (T3) & Thyroxine (T4): stimulated by TSH in anterior pituitary • Increase metabolism of glucose and fatty acids to increase energy and heat production • Essential for growth, development, and reproduction • Requires intake of iodine ▪ Calcitonin: stimulus is hypercalcemia • Inhibits resorption of calcium and phosphorous in blood so they stay in the blood (“TONE IT DOWN”) • ***resorption: breaks down bone tissue and releases calcium ions into circulation • ***reabsorption: process of absorbing a substance into blood again o Parathyroid Gland: 4 glands: 2 on back of each lobe ▪ Parathyroid hormone (PTH): antagonist to calcitonin • Target organs: bone, small intestines, and kidneys • Overall raises blood calcium level and lowers blood phosphate levels • ***homeostasis of blood calcium level is regulated by calcitonin and PTH o Adrenal Glands ▪ Adrenal cortex: located superior to each kidney; secretes 3 types of steroid hormones • Mineralcorticoids (aldosterone): think SALT; promotes reabsorption of sodium and excretes potassium by kidney tubules; helps maintain blood volume and blood pressure • Glucocorticoids (cortisol): think SUGAR; stimulates gluconeogenesis in liver and increases lipolysis and protein catabolism for energy; energy is required for proper brain functioning; also helps with anti-inflammatory effects BUT can lower immune response and delay healing • Gonadocorticoids (male androgens and female estrogens): sex; only source of estrogen after menopause; contribute to libido ▪ Adrenal Medulla: releases epinephrine and norepinephrine (catecholamines); they are sympathomimetic (fight or flight response) o Pancreas: secretes somatostatin to inhibit both insulin and glucagon (antagonists) ▪ Insulin: secreted by beta cells; stimulated by hyperglycemia; increases movement of glucose from blood into cells lowering blood glucose and making it available as energy ▪ Glucagon: secreted by alpha cells: stimulated by hypoglycemia o Duodenum o Ovaries o Testis: consist of two lobes connected by a piece of tissue called the isthmus ➢ Effects of Aging: most of the endocrine glands decrease secretion with age; normal aging usually does not lead to serious hormone deficiencies or illness o Decreased GH, TSH, and TH o Decreased insulin secretion and glucagon tolerance o Reduced sex hormones o Increased ADH o Reduced liver & kidney functions, use hormone replacements cautiously ➢ Nursing Assessment: o INSPECTION ▪ Mood and affect (emotional tone) ▪ Inspect the neck for thyroid enlargement ▪ Building eyes (exophthalmos) ▪ Weight change ▪ Tremors ▪ Posture ▪ Fat pads o PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT ▪ Palpation (thyroid gland is the only palpable endocrine gland) ▪ Peripheral pulses (posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis may be diminished in circulation issues) ▪ Skin turgor (sternum is common): dehydration = ADH insufficiency ▪ ***Remember the thyroid gland should NEVER be palpated in a patient with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism because this can stimulate secretion of additional thyroid hormone o DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ▪ Hormone test: (serum hormone levels, stimulation tests, suppression tests) ▪ Urine Tests ▪ Nuclear Scans (thyroid, radioactive iodine Uptake, PET Scans) ▪ Radiographic Tests (CT, MRI) ▪ Ultrasound ▪ Biopsy CHAPTER 39: Adrenal Disorders ➢ Pheochromocytoma: tumor of chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla; secretes catecholamines; usually benign o Etiology ▪ Usually unknown; mostly just hereditary o S/S (fight or flight) ▪ ***HTN (main one; diastolic can be 115 or higher; increased risk of CVA) ▪ Tachycardia ▪ Palpations ▪ Anxiety ▪ Headache ▪ Vison changes ▪ ***Risk for stroke, heart attacks, heart failure, vison changes, seizures, psychosis, and organ damage o Diagnostic tests ▪ 24hr urine (no caffeine or meds before) ▪ CT or MRI to find the tumor o Treatment ▪ Medications: beta blockers, alpha blockers, and calcium channel blockers ▪ Surgery: adrenalectomy o Nursing Care ▪ Monitor vitals ▪ Quiet and calm environment; reduce stressors ▪ No stressors ▪ Replace corticosteroids postoperatively ➢ Addison’s Disease: involves adrenal cortex; not enough cortisol; and/or not enough aldosterone or androgens; lack of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids o Etiology ▪ Autoimmune ▪ AIDS ▪ Cancer ▪ Pituitary or hypothalamus problems ▪ Abrupt discontinuance of steroids o S/S ▪ Hypotension (specifically postural hypotension) ▪ Hyponatremia (sodium loss) ▪ Hyperkalemia (potassium retention) ▪ Hypoglycemia ▪ Weakness and fatigue ▪ Weight loss ▪ GI disturbances ▪ Bronzed skin ▪ Changes in distribution of body hair ▪ Nausea and vomiting o Complications ▪ Occurs with exposure to stress, infection, trauma, psychological pressure ▪ ***Adrenal crisis: profound fatigue, dehydration, vascular collapse (decreased bp), renal shut down, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia which can lead to cardiac arrythmias o Treatment ▪ Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) and mineralcorticoids (fludrocortisone (Florinef)) are taken daily for remainder of life • 2/3 of dose in AM and 1/3 in PM; double or triple dose during stress ▪ Patients should wear a medic-alert bracelet ▪ Replace electrolytes o Nursing care ▪ Risk for deficient fluid volume: monitor vitals and fluid volume; daily weights ▪ Ineffective health management: lifelong treatment; identify causes of stress; educate about IM emergency kit (if pt is unable to take oral meds); may need to increase sodium intake during hot weather ▪ ***remember to NEVER ABRUPTLY DISCONTINUE STEROIDS; taper down to avoid adrenal crisis ➢ Cushing’s Syndrome: excess adrenal cortex hormones o Etiology ▪ ***most common cause: increased glucocorticoids (prednisone- taken for chronic inflammatory disorders- rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, Chron’s) ▪ Hypersecretion of ACTH by pituitary gland (result of benign pituitary tumor/adenoma which results in Cushing’s disease) o S/S ▪ Weight gain ▪ Truncal obesity (central obesity) ▪ Thin arms and legs ▪ Buffalo hump (fatty pad) ▪ Moon face (round face due to excess adipose tissue) ▪ Muscle wasting ▪ Striae ▪ Risk for osteoporosis, fractures (due to muscle atrophy) ▪ Risk for infection (due to anti- inflammatory and immunosuppressive action of cortisol) ▪ Mental status changes ▪ Androgen effects (acne, facial hair, amenorrhea) ▪ Sodium and water retention ▪ Hypokalemia ▪ Hyperglycemia ▪ Thin skin o Complications ▪ ***Secondary diabetes mellitus (insulin resistance and stimulates gluconeogenesis, resulting in glucose intolerance) o Diagnostic Tests ▪ Cushingoid appearance ▪ History of taking steroids ▪ Plasma and urine cortisol ▪ Plasma ACTH ▪ 24hur urine test for cortisol o Treatment ▪ Surgery (if tumor is present) ▪ Diet (high potassium, low sodium, high protein) ▪ Diabetes treatment if necessary ▪ Potassium supplements ▪ ***Alternate day therapy for steroids (before 9am): used when the cause is due to medications; the goal is to trick to pituitary to release ACTH so that the patient can taper off meds; doesn’t apply to those who have had adrenalectomies as they would need lifelong treatment o Nursing problems ▪ Excess fluid volume: stick with HCP’s ordered diet ▪ Risk for impaired skin integrity: Q2 turns, avoid harsh soaps and hot water, refrain from use of tape, pressure reducing mattress ▪ Risk for infection: hand hygiene, vaccinations for flu and pneumonia ▪ Risk for unstable blood glucose levels: insulin (remember that oral hypoglycemics usually aren’t effective) ▪ Disturbed body image: develop trust, allow patient to verbalize feelings ➢ Adrenalectomy: removal of the adrenal gland o Pre-op: monitor electrolytes and blood sugar o Post-op: assess for fluid and electrolyte balance, assess for adrenal crisis, educate about lifelong hormone replacement therapy (HCT), educate pt to contact HCP if unable to take HRT orally CHAPTER 39: Pituitary disorders ➢ Diabetes Insipidus (DI): insufficient ADH (water loss- think “DRY INSIDE”);
