Atrial Fibrillation Irregularly irregular Ventricles rate varies; atrial rate 350-600 bpm No “p” waves Unable to measure </=0.10 sec. Chaotic baseline- unable to see or measure a p wave. Patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation are at increased risk for stroke because clots forming atria 3 rd Degree Heart Block P to P regular; R to R regular Atrial 60-100 bpm; ventricular rate 40- 60 bpm Rounded, upright, alike No actual interval </=0.10 sec. Atrial and ventricle contractions are working independent of one another Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) Irregular (PVC interrupts underlying rhythm) Varies depending on underlying rhythm Absent before PVC QRS complex None >0.10 sec. HR, PR and QRS all depend on underlying rhythm. QRS of the PVC is longer than the QRS of the underlying rhythm. Ventricular Tachycardia (V-Tach, VT) Regular, can have some irregularity. 150-250 (can have “slow VT” with rate below 150) Absent None >0.10 sec. The occurrence of 3 or more PVC’s in a row. With V-tach the ventricles become the pacemaker of the heart instead of the SA node. Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib) Chaotic and extremely irregular. Not measurable None None None Ventricle quivers, unable to contract. Complete loss of cardiac output. Death results without intervention. Asystole None None None None None Absence of electrical activity in the heart muscle. Reference Williams, P. (2018). Fundamental concepts and skills for nursing. (5th ed.).
