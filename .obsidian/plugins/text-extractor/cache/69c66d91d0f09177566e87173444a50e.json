{"path":"Boxes/ChelseaFies/MED SURG. MOD 1 study guide!!!-Copy(1).pdf","text":"MED SURG.MOD 1 CHAPTER 38 ➢ Endocrine System contains: o Pineal Gland o Pituitary Gland (hypophysis): controlled by hypothalamus ▪ Anterior • Growth hormone (GH): regulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and by growth hormone inhibiting hormone (GHIH or somatostatin); stimulated by hypothalamus • Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): stimulates growth and secretions of thyroid gland; stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) • Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): stimulates secretions of cortisol and related hormones from adrenal cortex; stimulated from Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) o CRH: produced during exercise, stress, disease or hypoglycemia ▪ Posterior • Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): also known as “vasopressin”; increases water reabsorption by kidney tubules and urine output is decreased (maintains blood pressure) o Major fluid loss: hemorrhages; large amount of ADH secretion will result in arteriole vasoconstriction • Oxytocin: contractions and breastfeeding; acts as a positive feedback loop o Thyroid Gland ▪ Triiodothyronine (T3) & Thyroxine (T4): stimulated by TSH in anterior pituitary • Increase metabolism of glucose and fatty acids to increase energy and heat production • Essential for growth, development and reproduction • Requires intake of iodine ▪ Calcitonin: hypercalcemia is stimulus o Parathyroid Gland o Adrenal Gland (adrenal medulla & adrenal cortex) o Pancreas o Duodenum o Ovaries o Testis: consist of two lobes connected by a piece of tissue called the isthmus. . 3 hormones created are T3, T4, & Calcitonin (T3 + T4= TH) . T3 and T4 increase cellular respiration of glucose and fatty acids, which increases the metabolic rate that is, energy and heat production. . Sufficient iodine intake is required for T3 and T4 production. . The direct stimulus for secretion of T3 and is TSH from T4 the anterior pituitary. ⭐️Learning Tip⭐️ . An easy way to remember the function of calcitonin is to remember calciTONin TONes down Serum Calcium. ➢ Parathyroid Gland: . There are usually 4 parathyroid glands, 2 on the back of each lobe of the thyroid gland. . They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), an antagonist to calcitonin. . Besides bone, the target organs of PTH are the small intestine and kidneys. The overall effect of PTH is to raise the blood calcium level and lower the blood phosphate level. . Homeostasis of blood calcium level is regulated by calcitonin and PTH. ➢ Adrenal Glands: . The adrenal glands are located superior to each kidney. The inner adrenal medulla is surrounded by an outer adrenal cortex. ➢ Adrenal Medulla: . Norepinephrine . Epinephrine . These are released by the adrenal medulla, are sympathomimetic, meaning they MIMIC the sympathetic nervous system. . During stress, the hypothalamus stimulates their release to prolong the body's stress (fight or flight) response. ➢ Adrenal Cortex: . Mineralocorticoids (Aldosterone) Salt . Glucocorticoids (Cortisol) Sugar . Gonadocorticoids – Sex ➢ Pancreas: . Insulin- Secreted by the beta cells . Glucagon- secreted by the alpha cells. . It also secretes somatostatin, which inhibits both insulin and glucagon. . Hypoglycemia stimulates alpha cells to release glucagon. Glucagon raises blood glucose, making it available to cells. . Hyperglycemia stimulates beta cells to release insulin. . Insulin increases the movement of glucose from the blood into cells. This lowers blood glucose and makes glucose available to cells for energy. ➢ Aging & the Endocrine System: . Most of the endocrine glands decrease secretion with age, but normal aging usually does not lead to serious hormone deficiencies or illness. . Decreased GH . Decreased TSH and TH . Decreased insulin secretion . Decreased glucose tolerance . Reduced sex hormones . Increased ADH . Reduced liver & kidney functions, use hormone replacements cautiously ➢ Nursing Assessment: - INSPECTION . Observe the patient for mood and affect (emotional tone) throughout the physical assessment. . Inspect the neck for thyroid enlargement . Look for eyes that bulge (exophthalmos) . Mood/affect . Weight change . Tremors . Posture . Fat pads - PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT . Palpation (The thyroid gland is the only palpable endocrine gland) . Peripheral pulses . Skin turgor *Remember the thyroid gland should NEVER be palpated in a patient with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism because this can stimulate secretion of additional thyroid hormone. - DIAGNOSTIC TESTS . Hormone test: (serum hormone levels, stimulation tests, suppression tests) . Urine Tests . Nuclear Scans (thyroid, radioactive iodine Uptake, PET Scans) . Radiographic Tests (CT, MRI) . Ultrasound . Biopsy Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is likely to increase as people age The Beta cells in the pancreas secrete insulin Thyroid hormone (T3 and T4 collectively) and Calcitonin (it \"tones\" down calcium in the blood serum) CHAPTER 39 (Adrenal Disorders) ➢ Adrenal Disorders: . Most endocrine disorders are either primary or secondary. A primary disorder is a problem within the gland that is of balance. Secondary disorders are caused by problems outside the gland, such as an imbalance in a tropic hormone certain drug, trauma, surgery, or a problem in the feedback mechanism. - Adrenal Medulla: . Pheochromocytoma - Adrenal Cortex: . Hyperfunction - Cushing's Syndrome / Disease . Hypofunction Addison's disease ➢ Pheochromocytoma: . Tumor of chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla. . Secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) . Usually, benign Cause mostly unknown - Signs & Symptoms of Pheochromocytoma: • Fight or Flight: . Hypertension . Tachycardia . Palpitations . Anxiety . Headache . Vision changes . Risk for stroke! Main S&S is HIGH B/P \"Attacks\" Diastolic can be 115 or higher. Increased risk of CVA. - Diagnostic Tests of Pheochromocytoma: . 24hr Urine (No caffeine or meds before test) . CT or MRI to find tumor. - Treatment of Pheochromocytoma: . Beta-Blockers . Alpha Blockers . Calcium Channel Blockers . Adrenalectomy - Nursing care of Pheochromocytoma: . Monitor VS . Quiet, calm environment No Stress (Stress makes it much worse) . No caffeine . Replacement corticosteroids postoperatively ➢ Addison Disease: . Involves the adrenal cortex . Not enough cortisol - And /or not enough aldosterone - And / or not enough androgens . S & S from lack of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids - Causes of Addisons Disease: . Autoimmune . AIDS . Cancer . Pituitary or hypothalamus problem . Abrupt discontinuance of steroids - Signs & Symptoms: . Hypotension . Sodium loss (Hyponatremia) . Potassium retention (Hyperkalemia) . Hypoglycemia . Weakness . Fatigue . Bronze skin . N/V - Complications of Addisons: . Adrenal crisis- AKA Addisonian Crisis (Can be brought on by infection, injury, or any kind of stress) . Profound dehydration . Hypotension . Hypoglycemia . Shock, Coma, and even Death if untreated. . Hyponatremia (Decreased Sodium) . Hyperkalemia (Increased Potassium) causes cardiac dysrhythmias. - Treatment for Addisons Disease: . Glucocorticoids (Hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone (Florinef) daily for life. - 2/3 in AM & 1/3 in PM - Double or triple in times of stress . May be placed on high sodium diet. . Replace electrolytes. - Nursing Problems for Addisons: . Risk for deficient fluid volume . Ineffective health management - Nursing Care for Addisons: .

Report changes in mental status. *Teach Hormone replacement *Teach what to do if pt. Is unable to take oral meds. (IM emergency kit) *Encourage medic-alert *NEVER ABRUPTLY DISCONTINUE STEROIDS!! (Taper down slowly to avoid adrenal crisis) ➢ Cushing Syndrome: - Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is caused by exposure to excess cortisol This can occur because of an adrenal or pituitary gland problem, or from treatment with exogenous corticosteroids. - Causes: . Cushing syndrome can be caused by hyper-secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland. This is most often the result of a benign pituitary adenoma ( ACTH) . The most common cause of Cushing syndrome is prolonged use of glucocorticoid medication (Ex: prednisone) for chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, and Crohn disease. - Signs & Symptoms of Cushings: . Weight gain . Central/truncal obesity . Thin arms and legs . Fat pads on the upper back (buffalo hump) . Moon-shaped face result from deposits of adipose tissue at these sites. . Osteoporosis . Fractures . Mental status changes . Risk for infection. . Diabetes- hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance . Sodium & water retention . Hypokalemia . Thin skin . Acne . Facial hair . Amenorrhea - Diagnostic tests for Cushings: . Cushingoid appearance . History of taking steroids . Plasma and urine cortisol .

Diabetes treatment if needed . Every other day schedule for steroid therapy BEFORE 9am - Nursing Problems: . Excess Fluid Volume . Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity . Risk for Infection . Risk for Unstable Blood Glucose Level . Disturbed Body Image ➢ Adrenalectomy: - Pre-op: . Monitor electrolytes and blood sugars - Post-op: . Assess for fluid and electrolyte balance . Assess for adrenal crisis . Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for life . Teach pt. to contact Dr. immediately if unable to take HRT orally. ➢ Adrenal Crisis Tips: Can result from Addison's disease or after an adrenalectomy Results from insufficiencies of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids Main concern is hypotension and decreased fluid volume from hyponatremia The characteristic symptoms of Pheochromocytoma: - Hypertension, especially intermittent unstable hypertension. Tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, and vision changes are also seen. ⭐️ The signs and symptoms you typically see in a patient with Addisons Disease are - Hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, weakness and fatigue ⭐️ Typical symptoms in a patient with Cushing Syndrome are: - Weight gain, truncal obesity, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, sodium and water retention, osteoporosis CHAPTER 39 (Pituitary disorders) - Pituitary disorders Are caused by general hypopituitarism or hyperpituitarism. ➢ Pituitary Disorders: . A decrease in ADH activity results in diabetes insipidus (DI). An increase in ADH activity is called Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti Diuretic Hormone (SIADH). ➢ Diabetes Insipidus: . It is important to understand that DI is unrelated to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is caused by insulin resistant tissue or insufficient insulin production. DI is caused by a deficiency of ADH. . DI is caused because water is not reabsorbed in the kidneys, pts urinate 3-5 L/day, leading to dehydration and increased blood osmolality. - Signs & Symptoms of DI: . Polyuria (3-15 L a day) . Nocturia . High blood serum osmolality . Decreased urine specific gravity (Will be less than 1.005) . Extreme thirst (polydipsia) . Dehydration . Electrolyte imbalance and hypovolemic shock (can lead to death if untreated) . Increased Serum Gravity (Concentrated Blood) - Diagnosis of DI: . Low specific gravity, hypernatremia, water-deprivation test - Therapeutic Measures for DI: . Hypotonic IV fluids (ex. 0.45% Normal Saline), replace ADH (vasopressin) Also removal of pituitary tumor if it is the cause. - Nursing Process for DI: - Deficient fluid volume: . Dailey weights . I&O . Observe for dehydration (poor skin turgor and dry sticky oral membranes) . Monitor serum electrolytes . VS (monitor for low BP, high pulse, S&S of shock) ➢ SIADH: - Syndrome of inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone results from Too much ADH, water retention, hyponatremia, Hypo- osmolality. This causes excess water to be reabsorbed by the kidney tubules and collecting ducts and back into the blood, leading to decreased urine output and fluid overload. - Causes of SIADH: . Nervous system disorders (such as head trauma and meningitis) . Cancers (such as lung and brain cancer) . Pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . Medications (Antipsychotics & Histamines) *REMEMBER no matter what the cause of SIADH is, the result is INCREASED secretion of ADH, which results in FLUID OVERLOAD!!!! - Signs & Symptoms of SIADH: . Weight Gain (Without Edema) . Dilutional Hyponatremia . Concentrated Urine (High Specific Gravity) . Muscle cramps & weakness . Brain swelling . Seizures . Death if untreated - Diagnostic Tests for SIADH: . Serum sodium and osmolality are low, and urine sodium and osmolality are high. Serum ADH is high. - Therapeutic Measures for SIADH: . Restrict fluids to 800-1000 ml/day . Increase sodium (salt) in diet . Hypertonic IV fluids (If needed) . Lasix may be given to remove extra fluid . If tumor is the cause then surgical intervention will take place - Excess fluid volume: . Monitor vitals . Daily weight . Strict Is&Os . Lab values (Urine specific gravity) . Skin turgor . Observe for crackles . Observe for a bounding pulse . Maintain fluid restriction . Offer foods HIGH in sodium . Treat dry mouth with hard candy, gum, ice chips SIADH SUMMARY FILL IN THE BLANK!! Cause of SIADH is ______________. Which organ reabsorbs too much water? ______________. SIADH also causes Decreased ________Output, and __________. Any result below 1.005 is considered low specific gravity, while anything over 1.030 is considered _________________. As fluid builds up in the blood stream, it causes Decreased ____________ Osmolality. How to treat SIADH: Nursing Tasks: Daily weights, _______________, Observe for Fluid overload, watch for a Bounding____________. ➢ Growth Hormone Imbalance: - Growth hormone (GH) also called somatotropin, is responsible for normal growth of bones, cartilage, and soft tissue. - Short Stature (Dwarfism)= Too little (Deficit of GH) - Gigantism or Acromegaly = Too much (Excess of GH) ➢ Growth Hornone Deficiency: - Causes: . Damage to the pituitary gland. . Pituitary tumor . Failure of pituitary gland to develop . Psychosocial reasons (Neglect, or severe emotional stress) . MALNUTRITION is the MOST COMMON cause worldwide. - Treatment for GH deficiency: . Treatment of GH deficiency is administration of GH. . Synthetic GH (Somatropin) is given 3-7 times a week SUB-Q route. . Synthetic GH is given at Bedtime to mimic time of day this hormone is naturally secreted. . If there is tumor present, then surgical intervention will take place. ➢ Acromegaly (Gigantism): Acromegaly is a rare excess of GH that affects adults, usually in their 30s or 40s. If GH excess occurs in children, the result is gigantism. - Acromegaly: . Excess GH in adults . Bones grow in width, NOT length. . Organs and connective tissues also enlarge. - Causes of Acromegaly: . Excess secretion can be caused by Pituitary Hyperplasia . Problem with Hypothalamus - Signs & Symptoms of Acromegaly: . Symptoms develop very slowly, and the disorder may be present for years before it is recognized. . Increased size in ring size, and shoe size (Usually FIRST symptoms) . Enlarged hands, feet, nose, brow, and jaw. . Teeth displacement . Enlarged Tongue (Dysphagia) . Diabetes Mellitus due to increased blood glucose. . Patients may develop sleep apnea. - Treatment for Acromegaly: . Medications to block GH . Hypophysectomy if tumor present (Radiation may be prescribed), lifelong TH, ADH, steroid, possible sex hormone replacement. . Bromocriptune (Parlodel) may reduce GH level. . Bone growth and visual changes are permanent. ⭐️Tips for patients undergoing Hypophysectomy⭐️ . Pre-Op: Deep breathing, incentive spirometry, avoid straining and pressure on surgical site. . NO COUGHING POST-OP!!!! (This can cause intracranial pressure) . Post-Op: Neurological assessment, check urine for specific gravity, Nasal packing (check for CSF, Do NOT remove packing). Patient Education after Hypophysectomy . Small amount of drainage is normal . Only blow nose Gently . Utilize stool softeners . Antitussives if needed (NO COUGHING) . No brushing until lip incision healed . Take meds (Hormone Replacement medication) . Call the doctor if you develop a fever, increased drainage, increased thirst or urination, or any concerning S&S. A LIL Q & A FOR YA!! 1. What treatment would the nurse expect to see in a client with SIADH? Answer: 2. What signs and symptoms would the nurse expect to see in a patient who has diabetes insipidus? Answer: 3. Why should the nurse discourage coughing or vomiting after a client has had a hypophysectomy? Answer: CHAPTER 39 (Thyroid & Parathyroid) - T3 and T4 are thyroid hormones secreted by the thyroid gland. These Hormones are referred to as the thyroid hormone (TH). - Deficient secretion of TH= HYPOTHYROIDISM - Excess TH= HYPERTHYROIDISM ➢ Hypothyroidism: . Typically occurs in women over 50yrs of age. . DECREASED metabolism . Too little thyroid hormone (TH) . Primary Hypothyroidism = Primary hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough TH. (Most common is primary) . Secondary hypothyroidism = Secondary hypothyroidism is caused by low levels of TSH, which fail to stimulate the release of TH. . Adults associated with Myxedema (waxy non pitting edema) - Signs & Symptoms of Hypothyroidism: . Fatigue . Weight Gain . Bradycardia . Dry skin & Hair . Constipation . Decreased Appetite . Mental dullness . Cold intolerance . Hypoventilation *In advanced disease, myxedema develops, which is nonpitting edema of the face, hands and feet. - Complications of Hypothyroidism: . IF the metabolic rate drops so low that it becomes life threatening a Myxedema coma may occur. . To treat Myxedema Coma involves intubation and mechanical ventilation, slowly rewarded with blankets. IV fluids and IV Levothyroxine (Synthroid) are given. *Gerontology Tip: It may be difficult to see Hypothyroidism Symptoms in the elderly due to aging so really rely on your labs and scans for a diagnosis. - Myxedema Coma: . Usually triggered by stress . Hypothermia (Temp 95F) . Decreased respirations and LOC . Decreased blood glucose . Decreased cardiac output . Respiratory failure . Death - Treatment for Hypothyroidism: . Hormone Replacement (Levothyroxine) . The elderly are at higher risk of complications, especially CV. Hold medications and call the doctor if HR is over 100bpm. . Teach patient to take their own pulses - Nursing Problems W/ Hypothyroidism: . Activity intolerance . Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity . Imbalanced Nutrition (More than Body Requirements) ➢ Hyperthyroidism: . INCREASED METABOLISM . Too much Thyroid hormone (Excessive amounts of circulating TH) . Primary or Secondary Cause . Graves' disease is the most common cause. It is an autoimmune disorder in which thyroid-stimulating antibodies cause the thyroid gland to make too much TH . If given too much levothyroxine it could cause you to get hypothyroidism. - Signs & Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism: . Hyper metabolic state . Heat intolerance . Increased appetite . Weight loss . Frequent stools . Tachycardia palpitations . Tremors . Heart Failure . Warm, smooth skin . Graves’ disease (autoimmune disease) . Elderly signs & symptoms: Heart failure, A-FIB, palpitations, fatigue, depression - - Complications of Hyperthyroidism: . Thyrotoxic crisis (possibly after a thyroidectomy) .

Dyspnea (If there is an airway obstruction) . TH usually normal - Diagnostic tests: . Thyroid scan shows “Cold spot” . Biopsy . Treatment for thyroid cancer: Radioactive iodine, thyroidectomy (Partial or total) . Pre-Op Nursing care: Assess nutritional status, monitor breathing and swallowing, Iodine or antithyroid drugs to achieve euthyroid state, teach patient to use incentive spirometer, support neck during position changes. *Patients should be in a euthyroid state before surgery, to avoid complications during and after surgery. . Post-Op Nursing Care: Monitor vitals, airway swelling, bleeding on the back of the neck, check patients voice and have them speak, have a trach set at bedside, semi fowlers position, have calcium gluconate in case of tetany (twitching, muscle cramps), monitor patients Serum Calcium level. *NO COUGHING AFTER SURGERY!!! - Nursing problems for thyroidectomy: . Ineffective airway clearance . Acute pain . Risk of injury . Ineffective health management . Hemorrhage . Tetany (Treat with IV calcium) . Thyrotoxic crisis (Thyroid Storm) . Laryngeal Nerve damage > Parathyroid Gland Disorders: - Parathyroid Hormone (PTH): Regulates blood level of calcium > Hypoparathyroidism: (Decrease in PTH, Calcium stays in bones, hypocalcemia) - This is a decrease in PTH causes a decrease in bone resorption of calcium, a decrease in calcium absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, and decreased resorption in the kidneys. - The most common causes are heredity and the accidental removal of the parathyroid glands during a thyroidectomy. - Another cause is hypomagnesemia, which impairs secretion of PTH. - Signs & Symptoms of Hypoparathyroidism: . PTH is low . Serum calcium levels low . Phosphorus high . Positive Chvostek’s sign (early indication) . Positive Trousseau’s sign (early indication) . Exaggerated reflexes . Chronic Hypocalcemia (can cause lethargy, cataracts, convulsions) . TETANY- Neuromuscular irritability, numbness and tingling of fingers and lips, muscle spasms and twitching. - Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism: . IV calcium gluconate- Acute cases . Long term- Oral calcium with Vitamin D, High calcium diet. > Hyperparathyroidism: • Parathyroid overactivity • Increased PTH (In response to low serum calcium levels) • Hypercalcemia >Causes • Parathyroid hyperplasia • Benign parathyroid tumor • Heredity >S&S of • Hyperparathyroidism • Fatigue • Muscle weakness • Depression • Confusion • Increased urination • Anorexia • N & V • Kidney stones • Pathologic • Fractures • Cardiac • Arrhythmias • Abdominal pain • Peptic ulcers • Severe cases ◦ Coma ◦ Cardiac arrest • Increased serum calcium levels > Diagnosis of Hyperparathyroidism • Serum calcium elevated • Phosphorus • 24-hour urine sample (to see how much calcium is being excreted in urine) • PTH elevated • X-rays for decreased bone density > Treatment of Hyperparathyroidism • Mild cases ◦ Extra fluids ◦ Calcium & vitamin D, weight bearing exercise ◦ Monitor bone changes & renal function - Acute cases ◦ IV NS to dilute calcium ◦ Furosemide ◦ Calcitonin or alendronate ◦ Parathyroidectomy > Nursing Care of Hyperparathyroidism • Monitor S & S of hypercalcemia • Protect from pathological fractures • Pre- and postoperative care same as thyroidectomy > Treatment of Hyperparathyroidism • Extra fluids to dilute calcium (Mild hyperparathyroidism with asymptomatic hypercalcemia) • monitoring for bone changes and decline in renal function • weight-bearing exercise to keep calcium in the bones. • Oral calcium and vitamin D supplements may be prescribed. • Cinacalcet (Sensipar) is a newer drug that acts like calcium in the blood, fooling the parathyroid glands into reducing PTH secretion. • In acute hypercalcemia, IV normal saline is given to hydrate the patient. • Furosemide (Lasix) is given to increase renal excretion of calcium. • Cinacalcet (Sensipar) is a drug that mimics calcium circulating in the blood and can be administered to reduce PTH release from the parathyroids. • Biphosphonates (such as alendronate/Fosamax) or calcitonin • (Fortical) may be given to prevent calcium release from bones. • Surgery may be done to remove diseased parathyroid glands (parathyroidectomy). • Preoperative and postoperative care is similar to that of the patient undergoing thyroid surgery, with special attention paid to calcium and PTH levels. The patient will likely be on calcium and vitamin D supplements following surgery. > Nursing care of Hyperparathyroidism Monitor the patient for signs or symptoms of calcium imbalance and report promptly. Prompt treatment can prevent serious complications. • Encourage oral fluids to prevent dehydration and kidney stones and promote excrete calcium. • Encourage strengthening and weight-bearing exercises to help keep calcium in the bones. • Provide a safe environment for ambulation; assist the patient with ambulation if needed. A fall could result in fracture if bones are demineralized. • Encourage smoking cessation. Smoking causes bone loss. • Teach the patient symptoms to report and use of long-term medications so that the patient can manage self-care at home. EVALUATION. If the plan is effective, symptoms of hypercalcemia will be recognized and reported quickly, and complications and injury will be prevented > Acute Complications of Diabetes • Hyperglycemia • Hypoglycemia • Diabetic Ketoacidosis • Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemia > Hyperglycemia Causes: . Calories eaten exceed the amount of insulin available (overeating) . Stress – releases epinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone & glucagon (counterregulatory hormones) . Inadequate insulin or other medication . Chronic hyperglycemia leads to long term complications > Hypoglycemia: • Not enough glucose is available in relation to the circulating insulin. • Sometimes referred to as an insulin reaction • Defined at glucose level <70 mg/dL • Causes: skipping a meal, exercising more than usual or getting too much insulin or oral medication. > S&S of Hypoglycemia: • Hunger Tremor • Sweating Palpitations • Headache Pallor • Blurred vision • As hypoglycemia worsens, the brain is deprived of glucose and irritability, confusion, seizures, & coma may occur > Treatment of hypoglycemia: . To treat low blood glucose, administer a “fast sugar” (know type and amount of fast sugars) . If pt is not alert, give 50% glucose IVP or glucagon SQ. Recheck in 15 min & repeat until bld. glucose 70mg/dL or ↑ . Be careful not to over treat & send the pt. into hyperglycemia & rebound hypoglycemia. HOT&DRY =SUGAR HIGH COLD&CLAMMY=NEEDS SOME CANDY > Diabetic Ketoacidosis: (DKA) • Very high blood glucose levels • Deficient insulin • Type 1 diabetes – most often • Type 2 diabetes – late stage • Often why an undiagnosed, type 1 diabetic seeks help • Can result from stress or illnes > DKA CONT. . Insufficient insulin, cells starve . Body breaks down fat for energy . Fat breakdown releases an acid substance - ketones . As ketones build up in the blood ketoacidosis occurs. Body tries to correct acidosis by deepening respirations to blow off excess CO2 (Kussmaul’s resps) . Expired air has a fruity odor (caused by the ketones) AKA Acetone Breath – odor compared to “Juicy Fruit” gum Because of the high sugar levels and polyuria, the body becomes dehydrated . Tachycardia, hypotension & shock can result. . High sugar levels also cause K+ to: – leave cells – accumulate in the blood, causing hyperkalemia – then leave in urine, resulting in hypokalemia >DKA - Treatment IV fluids IV or subcu insulin Blood Glucose Monitoring Glucose is added to IVFs when sugar drops to 180mg/dL to avoid hypoglycemia Monitor potassium ABGs to monitor acidosis ID and treat cause Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) • AKA hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HHNK) syndrome • Type 2 diabetics, some insulin present • BG levels are high due to stress/illness • Some insulin present so cells do not starve; DKA usually doesn’t occur • HHS occurs more often in older adults HHS (cont.) As BG increases (hyperglycemia), polyuria causes extreme dehydration--- hyperosmolar (concentrated) state BG levels may rise to 1500 mg/dL and electrolyte imbalances occur Because ketoacidosis is not present, pt. may not feel as ill (as compared with a pt. who has DKA) & may delay seeking treatment >S/S HHS – Extreme thirst – Lethargy – Mental confusion Shock, coma & death occur if HHS is left untreated Mortality rate up to 20% >HHS Treatment & Prevention. Treatment – IV Fluids & Insulin – Glucose & electrolyte monitoring – ID the cause and treat Prevention – Careful BG monitoring at home – Increase fluids if blood glucose levels are getting high (esp. stress & illness) – Know when to report glucose results >Long Term Complications HHS Macrovascular – Circulatory system Microvascular – Eyes – Kidneys Nerve Complications Infection Foot Complications High incidence of strokes, heart attacks, & poor circulation in the feet & legs Control of BG, B/P, and cholesterol is vital to help prevent deadly complications. Avoid smoking, maintain normal wt. & exercise regularly ASA therapy, ACE inhibitors, statin drugs, ARB therapy for B/P control Microvascular Complications Eyes – Small blood vessels become diseased leading to retinopathy. – Small hemorrhages occur, which can lead to blindness – laser tx. may help – Good control of blood glucose and frequent eye exams may prevent blindness – Diabetes is also associated with high incidence of cataracts – Diabetics need annual dilated eye exam and may need to be seen more often Microvascular Complications Kidneys: – Nephropathy caused by damage to the tiny blood vessels within the kidneys, occurs in about 40% of pts – Risk factor – poor glucose control, some ethnic groups have higher risk – If nephropathy occurs, kidneys are unable to rid the body from waste products & excess fluid Microvascular Complications Kidneys (cont.) – Diabetes is leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in USA, treatment is hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis – The only cure for ESRD = kidney transplant – Teach importance of glucose control to prevent or delay kidney disease Kidneys (cont.) – ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can slow development of kidney problems in pts with DM and HTN – Routine urine tests to check for albumin in the urine – A renal dietician may be needed Microvascular Complications Nerve Complications - Neuropathy – Chronic hyperglycemia leads to nerve damage – good control of DM can help – Causes numbness & pain in extremities, sexual and erectile dysfunction, & gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) – Pain is difficult to treat, antidepressants, anticonvulsants like gabapentin & pregabalin can help. Good control of BG can help also Infection – Slow healing because of impaired circulation – In the presence of hyperglycemia, WBCs become sluggish & ineffective, further reducing the body’s ability to fight infection Foot Complications – Soft Tissue Soft tissue damage – ulcerations, especially at pressure points or from poor fitting shoes Results from poor circulation & neuropathy → slow, difficult healing, ↑ risk of infection & gangrene Foot complications bony structure – Charcot foot Charcot arthropathy –aka Charcot foot Cause – neuropathy → unrecognized injury with adequate blood supply = abnormal regulation of blood flow and ↑ blood supply. This leads to dislocation of joints and ↓ bone mass. New bone reforms, but in a deformed, unstable state. Foot Care Diabetes leading cause of amputations of the lower extremities Small sores can lead to gangrene if not treated Teach patients how to care for feet Inspect feet carefully Refer to podiatrist if problems occur Reactive Hypoglycemia Blood sugar drops ↓ 50 mg/dL without diabetes May be warning sign of impending diabetes Patho – Pancreas overproduces insulin S&S – Low BG causes epinephrine release which causes BG to rise and fight or flight response Reactive Hypoglycemia cont. Diagnosis – home BG monitoring when symptoms occur & give results to HCP Intervention – Small frequent meals, avoid fasting & simple sugars. High fiber, complex- carbohydrates & proteins are recommended Prevention Type 1 – unable to prevent Type 2 – can be prevented or delayed – Loss of 7% body weight – Regular exercise – 150 min. /week – metformin medication can delay – Frequently checking plasma glucose Treatment Only cure – pancreas transplant Diabetes can be controlled Diet and exercise Type 1 – insulin Type 2 – insulin or oral hypoglycemics, weight loss if overweight Blood glucose monitoring Education & frequent check-ups Goals of Treatment - ADA . Preprandial 80-130 mg/dL . Peak Postprandial ↓180 mg/dL . HgA1c ↓7% . B/P ↓140/90 > Nutrition Therapy: . Carbohydrates (carbs) contribute the most to Blood Glucose (BG) level Consistent amounts of carbs important Complete assessment by dietitian for individualized plan highly recommended Nutrition Notes, P. 821 Individualized plans by a certified DM educator are based on patient’s lifestyle, culture, etc Type 1 - prevent wide swings in BG Type 2 - diet should help with BG, B/P, blood lipids, and weight loss as needed People with DM should eat on a regular basis – every 4 -5 hours while awake Sucrose allowed as part of meal plan Nutrition Notes (cont.) Create your plate – from the ADA – ½ plate filled with nonstarchy vegetables (the more colorful the better) – ¼ filled with starchy foods (whole grains and starchy vegetables) – ¼ filled with meats or meat substitutes (protein) – Add a serving of fruit and 8 oz of non- fat milk Nutrition Notes (cont.) Carbohydrate Counting – Carbs have more effect on blood glucose than other nutrients – Classifies all carbohydrates together, whether from starch, fruit, or milk – Fat-free products usually have more carbohydrates Nutrition Notes (cont.) Glycemic Index – All carbohydrates are not metabolized identically – Some raise blood glucose more quickly than others – Based on glucose – value “100” – ex. – sweet potato has an index of 54 – peanuts have an index of 14 Fiber High Fiber recommended 25 – 30 g per day Reduces amount of insulin needed by lowering blood glucose Lowers blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels Helps pt. feel full longer (satiety) Water needs increase Exercise Lowers blood glucose for up to 48 hrs. after exercising Improves lipids & circulation Best to exercise 150 min./week – spread out over 3 or more days Avoid sedentary lifestyle, move every 30 minute","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
