**DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)** is a serious condition where abnormal [[Blood]] clotting occurs throughout the body's [[Blood]] vessels. This widespread clotting can lead to organ damage and uses up clotting factors, which paradoxically causes excessive bleeding. DIC is often a complication of severe infections, trauma, cancer, or other critical conditions.
