Five points per day (including weekends) will be deducted from late assignments beginning on the due date. All assignments must be completed and turned in for you to pass clinical. Dosage Calculation Exam: Students in the Vocational Nursing Program are expected to have proficiency in dosage calculation throughout the curriculum. Students are required to pass a Dosage Calculation Exam each semester in the program with a minimum score of 75%. A student who makes a grade below “75%” will be required to complete a remediation program as assigned by course faculty prior to the scheduled retake/make-up exam. This will be documented on a remediation form. The highest score that can be made on an exam after the first attempt is 75%. There will be a maximum of two attempts to pass the exam each semester. Absences for any of the exam attempts count as an attempt. (Ex. Absent for 1st exam, only 1 attempt remains). Students MUST PASS the Dosage Calculation Exam to pass clinical each semester. The dosage calculation exam will count as 10% of the clinical grade. The Summer Dosage Calculation exam is scheduled for Wednesday, June 26th, 2024. Exams may not be taken early. Students are expected to be present for all scheduled exams and will not be allowed into the testing area once the exam has started. Students who are absent for an on-campus class may or may not be given the option to stream the class. To be considered for the streaming process: o The student must notify each VN Nursing Instructor(s) in their various courses of their intended absence to be eligible for class streaming. o Request streaming at least one hour before the scheduled class time. o Refrain from recording lectures without the instructor's written consent (Please refer to the VN Student Handbook, Use of Electronic Technology and Office of Student Accommodations Recorded Lecture Agreement form). 5 If streaming is permitted, the student will still be counted as being absent. Summer Skills Checkoffs: Skills check-offs for vital signs, physical assessment, and indwelling catheter insertion are a required component of VNSG 1423. Students are required to pass vital sign and physical assessment checkoffs in the nursing simulation lab prior to attending the clinical site on the dates listed on the VNSG 1260 schedule. Students will have the opportunity to practice each skill before checking off on that skill. Students will have a maximum of 3 attempts to successfully check-off on each skill but are expected to be successful on their first attempt. There will be some open lab times available for students who feel they need extra practice time outside the required practice times. A student who does not pass a skill on the first attempt will be required to complete a remediation program prior to attempting the skill a second time. A student who does not pass a skill on the second attempt will be required to complete a remediation program prior to attempting the skill a third time. Remediation and re- check times will be assigned and may include Mondays through Thursdays from 9:00 am-6:00 pm. If a student is absent for any check-off attempts, they will not be allowed to make this up and will count as an attempt. Remediation is required prior to students’ subsequent checkoff(s). Failure to complete the remediation process will result in failure of VNSG 1260: Clinical-LVN Training I. Students MUST PASS all skills to pass VNSG 1423: Basic Nursing Skills AND VNSG 1260: Clinical-LVN Training I. Occurrence: For all Clinical syllabi/simulation instructions It is the obligation of the Temple College Nursing Program to prepare future nurses to provide quality and safety during all patient interactions. During a student’s simulation/clinical experience if an occurrence occurs, i.e., wrong dose, wrong medication, near miss, safety concerns are observed by faculty, the student will be required to: • Complete an occurrence reporting form by the end of clinical day and bring occurrence report with them to remediation. • Contact the simlab at 254-298-8660 to schedule and complete remediation. • Complete recommended remediation prior to the next clinical day. • Complete safety remediation as assigned prior to the next clinical day. 6 MST's Modular Skill Trainers Students may check out MST’s for at home practice. Students will be responsible for returning the MST in the same condition they receive it. Failure to return the MST or destruction of the MST will result in the student being responsible for the cost of replacement. Upon return of the MST, Students are asked to complete a short survey. Grading: A minimum grade of 75% or better is required to pass this course. The grading system used by the Temple College VN program is listed below. There will be no rounding of grades. Refer also to the Promotion Policy in the VN Student Handbook. A = 90% - 100% B = 80% - 89.99% C = 75% - 79.99% F = 74.99 and below (See attached Clinical Grading Scale) 7 Temple College Vocational Nursing Program Clinical Grading Scale Procedure: 1.
