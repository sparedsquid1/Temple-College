### Adverse Reactions 
Cytokines create an immune response, similar to having influenza and thus the symptoms experienced are referred to as “flu-like” symptoms. These symptoms include: 
- Chills
- Cough
- [[Fever]] 
- Headache
- Malaise

Other symptoms may include nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, reduced appetite, or diarrhea. Skin rashes, injection pain and inflammation, edema in the extremities, and antibody development can occur. Capillary leak syndrome can occur due to increased vascular permeability. As a result of greater permeability, fluid leaks out of the circulation and into surrounding tissues, causing edema and dangerously low [[Blood]] [[flow]], which in turn can damage organs. Cytokine storm may also occur where the body is flooded with cytokines and again can lead to tissue damage or death if untreated.

### Contraindications
[[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/Pre & Co Reqs/Summer 23/Note holder/A & P II/Interferons|Interferons]] are contraindicated in clients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the drug. A serious reaction of [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/Pre & Co Reqs/Summer 23/Note holder/A & P II/Interferons|Interferons]] may include neuropsychiatric symptoms, including [[Depression]], confusion, and manic behavior, which have been noted in clients both with and without a psychiatric history. Asymptomatic elevation in [[Liver]] enzymes has occurred; therefore, clients should be cautioned regarding [[Alcohol]] intake while using the drug. Caution is used when administering to clients with cardiac or [[Liver]] disease, history of seizure disorder, and thyroid problems. A reduction in white [[Blood]] cells makes clients susceptible to infection. 

Immunomodulators are not started during pregnancy. When the client is on cytokines, they are stopped when pregnancy is confirmed. Cytokines have been found in breast milk (Hale, 2012); therefore, lactation is discouraged.
