**[[arthralgia]]** refers to pain in one or more joints without accompanying inflammation. Unlike arthritis, which includes both pain and inflammation, [[arthralgia]] specifically refers to joint pain, and it can be a symptom of various conditions.

### Common Causes of Arthralgias:

1. **Injury or Overuse**:
   - Sprains, strains, or repetitive motion injuries can lead to joint pain.

2. **Infections**:
   - Viral infections such as the flu, [[hepatitis]], or chikungunya can cause transient joint pain.
   - Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks, can also cause [[arthralgia]].

3. **Autoimmune Diseases**:
   - Conditions like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis often cause joint pain.
   - These diseases involve the immune system mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues, including joints.

4. **[[Osteoarthritis]]**:
   - This is a common cause of joint pain in older adults. It involves the gradual wear and tear of joint cartilage, leading to pain and stiffness.

5. **Fibromyalgia**:
   - A chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, including joint pain, as well as fatigue and other symptoms.

6. **Gout**:
   - A type of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe joint pain, particularly in the big toe.

7. **Medications**:
   - Some [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], like certain antibiotics, statins, or chemotherapy agents, can cause joint pain as a side effect.

8. **Other Causes**:
   - Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during [[menopause]].
   - [[Blood]] disorders like sickle cell disease.
   - Metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism.

### Symptoms of Arthralgia:
- Joint pain can vary from mild to severe.
- Pain may be constant or it may come and go.
- It may affect one joint or multiple joints.
- Unlike arthritis, [[arthralgia]] does not involve visible joint swelling or redness.

### Diagnosis and Treatment:
- Diagnosis often involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and possibly imaging tests (like X-rays or MRIs) or [[Blood]] tests to identify underlying causes.
- Treatment depends on the cause of the [[arthralgia]] and may include:
  - Pain relievers (e.g., [[acetaminophen]] or [[Nonsterodial Anti-inflammatory Drugs]] like [[ibuprofen]]).
  - Rest and joint protection strategies.
  - Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the joints.
  - Treatment of the underlying condition, such as antibiotics for infections, or disease-modifying [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] for autoimmune diseases.

If the joint pain is persistent, severe, or associated with other symptoms like [[Fever]], weight loss, or swelling, it's important to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
