(ExtraPyramidal Syndrome)
Among the most significant adverse reactions associated with the antipsychotic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] are the extrapyramidal effects. The term extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) refers to a group of adverse reactions affecting the extrapyramidal portion of the nervous system as a result of antipsychotic [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]]. This part of the nervous system affects body posture and promotes smooth and uninterrupted movement of various muscle groups. [[Antipsychotics]] disturb the function of the extrapyramidal portion of the nervous system, causing abnormal muscle movement. Extrapyramidal effects include Parkinson-like symptoms, [[akathisia]], and [[dystonia]]. Extrapyramidal effects usually diminish with a reduction in the dosage of the antipsychotic drug. Switching to an [[SGA]] antipsychotic medication is helpful in reducing symptoms.
