aliases:
  - Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, a common condition in older men. The prostate surrounds the [[Urethra]], and as it enlarges, it can press against the [[Urethra]], leading to urinary symptoms.

### Common Symptoms of BPH:
- **Frequent Urination**: Especially at night (nocturia).
- **Urgency to Urinate**: A sudden, strong need to urinate.
- **Weak Urine Stream**: Difficulty starting urination, weak [[flow]], or dribbling at the end.
- **Incomplete Bladder Emptying**: Feeling that the bladder isn't fully empty after urination.
- **Straining to Urinate**: Difficulty starting urination or needing to push or strain to begin.
- **Urinary Retention**: In some cases, the inability to urinate, which can require urgent medical treatment.

### Causes:
- **Age**: BPH is most common in men over 50.
- **Hormonal Changes**: As men age, changes in hormone levels, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and [[estrogen]], are believed to contribute to prostate enlargement.
- **Family History**: A family history of BPH may increase the risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Obesity, lack of physical activity, and poor diet can also contribute.

### Diagnosis:
- **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)**: The doctor feels the prostate through the rectum to check for enlargement.
- **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test**: [[Blood]] test to measure PSA levels, which can be elevated in BPH and other prostate conditions.
- **Urinalysis**: To rule out infections or other conditions.
- **[[ultrasound]]**: To assess the size of the prostate.
- **Uroflowmetry**: Measures the strength of urine [[flow]].
- **Post-Void Residual Volume Test**: Measures how much urine remains in the bladder after urination.

### Treatment Options:
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding [[caffeine]] and [[Alcohol]], and regular physical activity.
- **Medications**:
  - **Alpha-Blockers**: Relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine [[flow]] (e.g., [[tamsulosin]]).
  - **5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors**: Shrink the prostate by reducing DHT levels (e.g., [[finasteride]], [[dutasteride]]).
  - **Combination Therapy**: A combination of alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.
- **Minimally Invasive Procedures**:
  - **Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)**: Removes part of the prostate.
  - **Laser Therapy**: Uses laser energy to remove prostate tissue.
  - **UroLift**: Implants that lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue away from the [[Urethra]].
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery might be necessary to remove the enlarged part of the prostate.

### Monitoring:
Men with BPH are often monitored over time to see if symptoms worsen. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are important to manage the condition effectively.

If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of BPH, consulting with a healthcare provider can help determine the best course of action.
