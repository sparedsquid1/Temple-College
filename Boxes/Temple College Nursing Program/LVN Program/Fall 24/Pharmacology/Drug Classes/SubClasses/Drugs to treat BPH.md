### Adverse Reactions 
Adverse reactions usually are mild and do not require discontinuing use of the drug. Some of the adverse reactions seen with the administration of alpha-[[Adrenergic]] blockers are as follows: weight gain, fatigue, dizziness, and transient orthostatic hypotension. Adverse reactions of the AHI [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]], when they occur, are related to the sexual drive and include impotence, decreased libido, and a decreased volume of ejaculation. Changes to breast tissue—pain or tenderness, nipple discharge, or enlargement—can occur while taking AHIs.

### Contraindications
Both alpha-[[Adrenergic]] blockers and AHI [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] should be used with caution in clients with hepatic or renal disease. Caution the client with hypertension when using both beta- and alpha (α)-blockers that hypotensive symptoms may be increased.
