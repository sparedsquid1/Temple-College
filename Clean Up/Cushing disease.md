Cushing's disease is a specific form of [[Cushing's syndrome]], which is a condition caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of [[cortisol]], a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Cushing's disease specifically refers to a situation where the excess [[cortisol]] is due to a pituitary gland tumor that produces too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This overproduction of ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive [[cortisol]].

### Causes:
- **Pituitary Adenoma:** The most common cause of Cushing's disease is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor of the pituitary gland, known as a pituitary adenoma. This tumor secretes excess ACTH, leading to overstimulation of the adrenal glands and excessive [[cortisol]] production.
- **Ectopic ACTH Syndrome:** Rarely, ACTH is produced by tumors located outside the pituitary gland, such as in the lungs or [[Pancreas]], but when it's from the pituitary, it's specifically termed Cushing's disease.

### Symptoms:
The symptoms of Cushing's disease develop gradually and can vary widely among individuals, but common features include:

- **Weight Gain and Fat Redistribution:**
  - **Central Obesity:** Weight gain, particularly around the abdomen and trunk.
  - **Buffalo Hump:** Fat accumulation on the back of the neck and upper back.
  - **Moon Face:** A rounded, puffy face.

- **Skin Changes:**
  - **Purple Striae:** Wide, purple stretch marks on the abdomen, thighs, breasts, and arms.
  - **Thinning Skin:** Skin that bruises easily and heals slowly.
  - **Acne** or **facial redness.**

- **Muscle Weakness:** Particularly in the upper arms and legs, leading to difficulty in climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, or lifting objects.

- **Bone Changes:**
  - **Osteoporosis:** Increased risk of fractures due to weakened bones.

- **High [[Blood]] Pressure (Hypertension):**
  - [[cortisol]] affects [[Blood]] pressure regulation, leading to hypertension.

- **High [[Blood]] Sugar (Hyperglycemia):**
  - **Type 2 Diabetes:** Can develop due to insulin resistance caused by excess [[cortisol]].

- **Mood and Cognitive Changes:**
  - **[[Depression]], [[anxiety]], or Irritability.**
  - **Memory Problems and Cognitive Decline.**

- **Menstrual Irregularities in Women:**
  - **Amenorrhea:** Loss of menstrual periods or irregular periods.
  - **[[Hirsutism]]:** Excessive hair growth on the face, chest, and abdomen.

- **Decreased Libido and Erectile Dysfunction in Men.**

### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of Cushing's disease involves several steps, including:

- **Urinary Free [[cortisol]] Test:** Measures [[cortisol]] levels in urine collected over 24 hours.
- **Late-Night Salivary [[cortisol]] Test:** Measures [[cortisol]] levels in saliva late at night, when [[cortisol]] should be low.
- **Low-Dose [[dexamethasone]] Suppression Test:** A test where [[dexamethasone]] (a synthetic steroid) is given to suppress [[cortisol]] production; in Cushing's disease, [[cortisol]] remains high.
- **ACTH Levels:** [[Blood]] tests to measure ACTH levels, which are typically elevated in Cushing's disease.
- **Imaging Studies:** MRI scans of the pituitary gland to detect the presence of a tumor.

### Treatment:
The treatment for Cushing's disease primarily focuses on reducing [[cortisol]] levels to normal and addressing the underlying cause:

- **Surgery:** The most common treatment is the surgical removal of the pituitary tumor (transsphenoidal surgery). This is often curative.
- **Radiation Therapy:** If surgery is not fully successful or the tumor recurs, radiation therapy may be used to target the remaining tumor cells.
- **Medications:** [[Boxes/Temple College Nursing Program/LVN Program/Fall 24/Pharmacology/Drugs/Drugs|Drugs]] such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, or [[mitotane]] may be used to reduce [[cortisol]] production if surgery is not possible or is only partially effective.
- **Adrenalectomy:** In rare cases where other treatments are not effective, removal of the adrenal glands may be necessary, which would then require lifelong [[cortisol]] replacement therapy.

### Prognosis:
With proper treatment, many people with Cushing's disease can achieve normal [[cortisol]] levels and relief from symptoms. However, recovery may be gradual, and some symptoms, particularly those related to bone density and muscle strength, may take longer to improve. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve the long-term outlook.
